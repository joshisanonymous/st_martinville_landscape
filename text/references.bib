	abstract = {This article explores variation in the use of the pronouns nous and on for first person plural reference in a substantial corpus of French-language Internet chat discourse. The results indicate that on is nearly categorically preferred to nous, which is in line with previous research on informal spoken French. A qualitative analysis of nous tokens suggests that the use of this variant is limited to certain contexts, such as jokes, imitations and role-plays, or in order to refer to a group “seen from the outside.” This research has implications for the study of discourse produced in electronic environments in relation to speech and writing. In concluding, the fate of nous is discussed and directions for future research on computer-mediated communication are advanced.},

some aspects of the structured variation found in adult speech are evident
in children's speech from the very start of language acquisition, and
input from the primary caregiver is crucial in this process. In this
article we contribute to this research by conducting a cross-sectional
analysis of the acquisition of variable forms in a Scottish dialect. Two
linguistic variables are targeted in the speech of eleven children
(2;10–3;6) and their primary caregivers. Quantitative analysis of
over 5000 contexts of use demonstrates that one variable is conditioned by
social and linguistic constraints in the speech of the caregiver and these
constraints are matched by the children. In contrast, the other variable
is influenced by a complex array of linguistic constraints only. We
explore the ramifications of these findings for understanding the
mechanisms involved in acquisition of variation from the very earliest
stages.We gratefully acknowledge the

	abstract = {We discuss some apparent limits on the acquisition of variation suggested by our recent work exploring how teenage migrants to the U.K. acquire local norms of variation. We focus on the constraints on the (ing) variable that emerged from a multivariate analysis. We find evidence for a systematisation of the variable among immigrants, involving some linguistically and cognitively predictable constraints, but also the emergence of social constraints not found in the teenage native speakers. We argue that transformation of variable constraints is a necessary artefact of the inherent complexity of sociolinguistic variables, particularly those with social indexicality. This research note: (1) delineates some theoretical and practical questions involved in incorporating social indexing in variationist studies, especially of non-native speakers; and (2) further explores reallocation (transformation) in the study of language contact. Wir behandeln mögliche Grenzen des Erwerbs soziolinguistischer Variation, die unsere jüngste Studie zum Erwerb lokaler Variationsnormen jugendlicher Immigranten in Großbritannien zu zeigen scheint. In unserer Ergebnisdarstellung konzentrieren wir uns auf die Faktoren, die die Verwendung der (ing) Variable beschränken. Die Ergebnisse gingen aus einer multivariaten Datenanalyse hervor. Wir zeigen, dass die Variable unter Immigranten systematisiert wird, was das Erscheinen einiger linguistischer und kognitiv voraussagbarer Faktoren aber auch einiger interessanter sozialer Faktoren einschließt, die nicht unter den jugendlichen Muttersprachlern gefunden werden konnten. Wir zeigen weiterhin, dass die Umwandlung variabler Faktoren ein notwendiges Artefakt der inhärenten Komplexität soziolinguistischer Variablen ist, insbesondere von Variablen mit sozialer Indexikalität. Diese Notiz umreißt einige praktische Fragen in Bezug auf (1) die Einfügung sozialer Indizes in variationslinguistische Studien, insbesondere solcher, die Nicht-Muttersprachler betreffen, und (2) die weitere Erforschung des Prozesses der Umverteilung in der Untersuchung von Sprachkontaktphänomenen.

Essential to understanding this case of variation is the consideration of prominent features of the communicative situation, as well as the social identities and roles assumed by the speakers within it (including professional affiliation, transactional vs. interpersonal communicative stance and gender).

Although grammars of French have traditionally passed over indefinite tu/vous in silence, Ashby's study of Tours French (1992) confirmed that the phenomenon exists in metropolitan French also. The historical time-depth of indefinite tu/vous has apparently not been explored previously, though Posner (1997) has suggested that indefinite tu is a modern feature, found especially in Canada. A survey of indefinite tu/vous in earlier periods and in a range of varieties forms the first part of this paper. Secondly, drawing on a corpus of French spoken in Picardy, northern France, the paper investigates the extent to which this use of the 2nd person pronouns: (i) helps to avoid ambiguity; (ii) co-occurs with another grammatical variable. Unlike the surveys of Montreal and Tours, the Picardy corpus includes a large majority of informants who used tu to address the interviewer, and this too is explored as a potential influence on speakers’ use of 2nd person pronouns with indefinite reference.},

An analysis of the morphophonological variable (ing) was carried out using recordings and ethnographic observations of 13 young American women during and after their final years of high school. Offering a detailed look at the late adolescent life stage, the study also explores speakers’ motivations for retaining or retreating from nonstandard variants as they prepare to enter adulthood. These are examined at both the group and the individual level. The results indicate that the degree of retreat from nonstandard variants is socially differentiated, in line with apparent time findings. Future enrollment in a locally oriented college, and alignment to a local ethnic network (Irish or Italian)—not social class—were the predictors of retention in high school.},

Building on the foundational work of Labov et al. (2006, 2011) on the “sociolinguistic monitor” (a proposed cognitive mechanism responsible for sociolinguistic perception), we examine whether listeners’ evaluative judgments of speech change as a function of the type of variable presented. We consider two variables in British English, ING and TH-fronting, which we argue differ in their relative social salience. Replicating the design of Labov et al.’s studies, we test 149 British listeners’ reactions to different quantitative distributions of these variables. Our experiments elicit a very different pattern of perceptual responses than those reported previously. In particular, our results suggest that a variable’s social salience determines both whether and how it is perceptually evaluated. We argue that this finding is crucial for understanding how sociolinguistic information is cognitively processed.},

As predicted, profession shifted the impact of (ING) on perceived knowledgeability, such that professors were seen as more knowledgeable when using -ing, whereas experienced professionals were more knowledgeable in their -in guises. Use of -in also made all speakers sound less caring and created a positive relationship between political progressiveness and caring in perceptions of political candidates.},

	abstract = {This article describes the preparation, recording and orthographic transcription of a new speech corpus, the Nijmegen Corpus of Casual French (NCCFr). The corpus contains a total of over 36 h of recordings of 46 French speakers engaged in conversations with friends. Casual speech was elicited during three diﬀerent parts, which together provided around 90 min of speech from every pair of speakers. While Parts 1 and 2 did not require participants to perform any speciﬁc task, in Part 3 participants negotiated a common answer to general questions about society. Comparisons with the ESTER corpus of journalistic speech show that the two corpora contain speech of considerably diﬀerent registers. A number of indicators of casualness, including swear words, casual words, verlan, disﬂuencies and word repetitions, are more frequent in the NCCFr than in the ESTER corpus, while the use of double negation, an indicator of formal speech, is less frequent. In general, these estimates of casualness are constant through the three parts of the recording sessions and across speakers. Based on these facts, we conclude that our corpus is a rich resource of highly casual speech, and that it can be eﬀectively exploited by researchers in language science and technology.},

Research is reviewed, indicating how characteristics of individual tie (e.g., tie strength, proximity, frequency of contact, similarity) are related to the provision of support. Also examined are how characteristics of the personal network (e.g., size, density) relate to support and wellbeing. Statistical models for network analysis and how they should prove useful in studying social support are then discussed.},

	abstract = {Louisiana French is undergoing gradual language death. In such situations, it is common to find increased variability and rapid change, as speakers use the language less often and in fewer domains (Wolfram 2004; Palosaari and Campbell 2011). These processes have been observed in the pronominal system of Louisiana French (Rottet 1996; Girard 2013), with both phonological and morphological sources of variation leading to an exceptionally large inventory of first-person-singular forms in the French of the Pointe-Au-Chien Indians of Pointe-Aux-Chênes, Louisiana. Using data from a translation task, we examine the range of forms used by French speakers from this community varying in age and fluency. We note a sharp distinction in forms used by fluent versus non-fluent speakers, with the latter making use of the non-clitic form mon. To answer the question of why mon is so common amongst non-fluent speakers in this task, we apply insights from the field of second language acquisition, considering the systems of these non-fluent speakers as autonomous and systematic. We ultimately propose a potential interaction between the previously documented phonological and morphological patterns observed in this community, influencing in the forms observed.},

We suggest interpretations of certain sociolinguistic findings, citing detailed evidence from research in Northern Ireland and Philadelphia, which emphasize the need for acknowledging the importance of looseknit network ties in facilitating linguistic innovations. We then propose that the link between network and class can be made via the notion of weak network ties using the process-based model of the macrolevel suggested by Thomas Højrup's theory of life-modes.]},

	abstract = {One of the most striking characteristics of Shaba Swahili/French conversations is the near-exclusive use of French discourse markers. It is shown that from a structural point of view, the use of French markers presents no serious problems. Of course, the mere structural possibility of switching French markers cannot explain their near- categorical use. This phenomenon is best explained by taking into account the function of discourse markers as elements that create and strengthen discourse cohesion and coherence. In order to accomplish this task, discourse markers have to be as salient as possible. In bilingual discourse, this saliency may be maximized by using discourse markers from the language that is most salient. Since the language of morpho-syntax in Shaba Swahili/French discourse is Shaba Swahili, French markers stand out more clearly and have a higher contrastive value than their Shaba Swahili counterparts. Hence, French discourse markers are used instead of their Shaba Swahili equivalents. The importance of increasing contrastiveness as a way of maximizing saliency is evident from the fact that French markers are predominantly accompanied by pauses and/or prosodic cues, and from the fact that they predominantly occur in all-Shaba Swahili contexts, that is, they are followed and preceded by Shaba Swahili material in the majority of cases.},

It constitutes the first monograph in the fields of Hebrew interactional linguistics and Hebrew discourse markers. The book first presents what is unique to the present approach to discourse markers and gives them an operational definition. Discourse markers are explored as a system, illuminating their patterning in terms of function, structure, and the moments in interaction at which they are employed. Next, detailed analysis of four Hebrew discourse markers illuminates not only the functions and grammaticization patterns of these markers, but also what they reveal about quintessential aspects of Israeli society, identity, and culture. The conclusion discusses commonalities and differences in the grammaticization patterns of the four markers, and relates the grammaticization of discourse markers from interaction to projectability in discourse.},

	abstract = {The role of gender in language change, as discussed
in Eckert (1989a) and Labov (1990), forms the context for
an exploration of the role of gender in the development
of Cajun English. Neither Principle I, Ia, or II predicts
the role of gender in Cajun English, which leads us to
question the generalizability of the principles to the
specific sociolinguistic setting of this study—a
closed cultural enclave. The study of four sociolinguistic
variables and three generations of speakers reveals two
patterns of language change: a curvilinear or v-shaped
age pattern and a linear age pattern. These patterns relate
 in a complex way to changes from above and below the level
of consciousness. We support Eckert's call for a finer
specification of the social categories but suggest alternatives
to the ethnographic method. Using a variety of sources
of information on the social life and sociohistory of three
generations, we find an intimate association between the
sociohistory of this Cajun community and the linguistic
behavior of each generation.},

In this article I document these two interrogative patterns as to form and locales of attestation, and I explore the evidence for Byer's claim, showing that a strong case can be made by considering not only settlement history but also the interrogatives of Louisiana Creole, the origins of which arguably predate the arrival of the Acadians in Louisiana.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study examined whether child speakers of Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE) who were also perceived by some listeners to present a Cajun/Creole English (CE) influence within their dialects produced elevated rates of 6 phonological and 5 morphological patterns of vernacular relative to other SAAE- and SWE-speaking children. Method: A group comparison design was followed. The data were listener judgments, 1-min audiotaped excerpts of conversational speech, and transcribed language samples from 93 children (31 classified as specifically language impaired while the others were classified as either aged-matched or language-matched controls; 13 classified as SWE with CE, 40 classified as SWE only, 18 classified as SAAE with CE, and 22 classified as SAAE only). Results: Results indicated that children with a CE influence produced elevated rates of vernacular phonology relative to the others, with 2 patterns (nonaspirated stops and glide reduction) showing statistically significant group differences. In contrast, the children's use of vernacular morphology was unrelated to their CE status, but was instead related to their primary dialect (SWE vs. SAAE) and language ability classification (impaired vs. normal). Conclusions: The findings highlight the role of phonology in listeners' perceptions of dialect variation within 2 nonmainstream dialects (SWE and SAAE). The findings also demonstrate the ways phonological and morphological forms of vernacular can be independently influenced by different types of child variables.},

In this chapter, I undertake to shed some light on this system as concerns, for instance, the use of a focus particle. I also show how interrogative data can be brought to bear on a recent scholarly debate concerning the number of geneses of Creole in Louisiana. In particular, I will provide evidence for the position taken by Klingler (2000), by giving further linguistic evidence that the Mississippi variety of LC has more in common with Haitian Creole than does the Bayou Teche variety.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that people routinely use perceptual information during language comprehension and conceptual processing, from single-word recognition to modality-switching costs in property verification. In investigating such links between perceptual and conceptual representations, the use of modality-specific stimuli plays a central role. To aid researchers working in this area, we provide a set of norms for 423 adjectives, each describing an object property, with mean ratings of how strongly that property is experienced through each of five perceptual modalities (visual, haptic, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory). The data set also contains estimates of modality exclusivity-that is, a measure of the extent to which a particular property may be considered unimodal (i.e., perceived through one sense alone). Although there already exists a number of sets of word and object norms, we provide the first set to categorize words describing object properties along the dimensions of the five perceptual modalities. We hope that the norms will be of use to researchers working at the interface between linguistic, conceptual, and perceptual systems. The modality exclusivity norms may be downloaded as supplemental materials for this article from brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This monograph connects the jackknife, the bootstrap, and many other related ideas such as cross-validation, random subsampling, and balanced repeated replications into a unified exposition. The theoretical development is at an easy mathematical level and is supplemented by a large number of numerical examples. The methods described in this monograph form a useful set of tools for the applied statistician. They are particularly useful in problem areas where complicated data structures are common, for example, in censoring, missing data, and highly multivariate situations.},

Data included 10 spontaneous informal conversations between near-native speakers of French and native speakers (NSs) closely acquainted with them. Although some near-native speakers retained ne more frequently than their interlocutors, others produced ne at rates indistinguishable from the NSs. A variationist analysis of 1,877 examples of negation revealed that the near-native speakers had largely acquired the relevant linguistic and sociostylistic factors that condition NS use, although an important subset of the near-native speakers did not vary their ne use according to whether the negation appears in a lexicalized or nonlexicalized phrase. The results contribute to understanding L2 near-nativeness, specifically with respect to sociolinguistic competence in adult learners.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates the need for a uniform model of discourse variation analysis which is equipped to capture the complex nature of discourse variation and change whilst also ensuring generalizability. A review of the literature shows that the current heterogeneity in corpus construction, data quantification and theorizing of discourse variables impedes reliability and intersubjectivity. Suggestions are offered to achieve comparability, and a case is made for a consistent integration of pragmatic function as a factor group in the analysis. The extension of the variationist paradigm to the level of discourse is discussed, and the need for a definition of discourse variables which caters for their flexibility and multifunctionality is demonstrated. It is argued that some methodological consistency is required in variationist discourse analysis in order to advance towards a holistic description of patterns in language variation and change which spans all components of the grammar, and to systematically explore how discourse features are used and manipulated to create social identities. Dieser Beitrag plädiert für eine einheitliche Methode zur Diskursvariationsanalyse, welche der Komplexität von Dikursvariationen gerecht wird und Generalisierungen zulässt. Der Literaturüberblick ergibt, dass die gegenwärtige Heterogenität in der Zusammenstellung von Korpora, Datenquantifizierung und Konzeptualisierung von Diskursvariablen Zuverlässigkeit und Intersubjektivität beeinträchtigt. Es werden Vorschläge unterbreitet, wie man Vergleichbarkeit sicher stellen kann, und es wird für eine konsistente Integration von pragmatischen Funktionen als Faktorengruppe in der Analyse plädiert. Die Anwendung eines variationistischen Ansatzes auf die Analyse von Diskursmarkern wird erörtert. Des Weiteren wird die Notwendigkeit illustriert, Diskursmarker als Variable zu definieren, wobei ihre Flexibilität und Multifunktionalität berücksichtigt werden muss. Methodische Konsistenz ist erforderlich, um eine umfassende Theorie von Sprachvariation und -wandel zu formulieren und um systematisch zu analysieren, wie diese Variablen zur Konstruktion von sozialen Identitäten verwendet werden.},

This extension, however, has not been without controversy and continues to fuel heated debates in the field. This article addresses some of the contentious issues that quantitative research on (morpho-)syntactic variation has brought about. Can we operationalise variation in the field of morphosyntax as a sociolinguistic variable? If yes, how do we define such a variable? Is morphosyntax constrained in the same way as variation in the sound system? How do we quantify variability in the field of morphosyntax in an accountable manner? What do we quantify out of? I also introduce some of the methods used by researchers dealing with non-phonological variation, focusing especially on the quantification of morphosyntactic and discourse variables.},

This paper gives an evaluation of the basic assumptions underlying both the concept of the vowel space and the utility of the VSA in making cross-dialectal and sound change comparisons. Using cross-generational data from 135 female speakers representing three distinct dialects of American English, the first step was to establish that the vowel quadrilateral fails as a metric in the context of dialect variation. The next step was to examine the efficacy of more complete assessments of VSA represented by the convex hull and the concave hull. Despite the improvement over the quadrilateral, both metrics yielded inconsistent estimates of VSA. This paper then explores the possibility that regional variation can be characterized more effectively if formant dynamics and the resulting spectral overlap were also considered in defining the space. The proposed formant density approach showed that the working space may be common to all dialects but the differences are in the internal distribution of spectral density regions that define dialect-specific “usage” of the acoustic space. The dialect-inherent distribution of high and low density regions is largely shaped by sound change.},

	abstract = {This book is the revised and extended second edition of Statistics for Linguistics with R. The volume is an introduction to statistics for linguists using the open source software R. It is aimed at students and instructors/professors with little or no statistical background and is written in a non-technical and reader-friendly/accessible style. It first introduces in detail the overall logic underlying quantitative studies: exploration, hypothesis formulation and operationalization, and the notion and meaning of significance tests. It then introduces some basics of the software R relevant to statistical data analysis. A chapter on descriptive statistics explains how summary statistics for frequencies, averages, and correlations are generated with R and how they are graphically represented best. A chapter on analytical statistics explains how statistical tests are performed in R on the basis of many different linguistic case studies: For nearly every single example, it is explained what the structure of the test looks like, how hypotheses are formulated, explored, and tested for statistical significance, how the results are graphically represented, and how one would summarize them in a paper/article. A chapter on selected multifactorial methods introduces how more complex research designs can be studied: methods for the study of multifactorial frequency data, correlations, tests for means, and binary response data are discussed and exemplified step-by-step. Also, the exploratory approach of hierarchical cluster analysis is illustrated in detail. The book comes with many exercises, boxes with short think breaks and warnings, recommendations for further study, and answer keys as well as a statistics for linguists newsgroup on the companion website. Just like the first edition, it is aimed at students, faculty, and researchers with little or no statistical background in statistics or the open source programming language R. It avoids mathematical jargon and discusses the logic and structure of quantitative studies and introduces descriptive statistics as well as a range of monofactorial statistical tests for frequencies, distributions, means, dispersions, and correlations. The comprehensive revision includes new small sections on programming topics that facilitate statistical analysis, the addition of a variety of statistical functions readers can apply to their own data, a revision of overview sections on statistical tests and regression modeling, a complete rewrite of the chapter on multifactorial approaches, which now contains sections on linear regression, binary and ordinal logistic regression, multinomial and Poisson regression, and repeated-measures ANOVA, and a new visual tool to identify the right statistical test for a given problem and data set. The amount of code available from the companion website has doubled in size, providing much supplementary material on statistical tests and advanced plotting.},

However, such frequencies in isolation may sometimes be misleading since they do not take into consideration the degree of dispersion of the relevant linguistic variable. Many dispersion measures and adjusted frequency measures have been suggested but are neither widely known nor applied. Another unfortunate aspect of such measures is that many also come with a variety of problems. I pursue three objectives with this article. First, I want to raise awareness of this issue and make the available measures more widely known, so I present an overview of many measures of dispersion and adjusted frequencies. Second, I propose a conceptually simple alternative measure, DP, explain and exemplify it, and compare it to previously discussed measures. Third and most importantly, I urge corpus linguists to explore the notion of dispersion in more detail and outline a few proposals which steps to take next.},

It demonstrates how, by digitally manipulating the speech of isolated individuals, it is possible to obtain reliable evidence that pitch range and sibilant duration may act as indexical of a gay male identity. Further scrutiny of this result, however, illustrates that linguistic indexicality is not as straightforward as it originally appears. Subsequent analyses of the data highlight the ways in which the perceptual evaluation of sexuality is a highly contingent process, dependent upon a variety of sociolinguistic factors. An envelope of variation in listeners' affective judgments of a speaker is shown to exist, and it is argued that research on the perception of identity must go beyond identification of salient features, and also consider when and why these features are not salient.},

Data from 73 speakers across three age groups and two sexes are analysed, for a total of almost 6,000 vowel tokens. The move to a quantity distinction is confirmed for the strut‒start contrast. In the case of dress and fleece, younger and female speakers show greater overlap of the two vowels but also stronger diphthongisation of fleece. The data also confirm the fronting of foot away from thought and towards goose, but with no evident adjustment in durational contrasts or in the diphthongisation of either long vowel. Kit is becoming increasingly centralised, especially in the speech of young women, and is as a consequence becoming more distinct from nurse. The findings are discussed in the context of the system of vowel contrasts in this variety.},

In particular, the research examines the potentially differing effects of white and African-American fieldworkers on interviews with African-American interviewees. Differing effects would be important for two reasons. First, much of the evidence on African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) comes from fieldwork done by whites. If black and white fieldworkers affect the data in significantly different ways, then much of the existing knowledge base on AAVE is open to question. Second, differing effects of fieldworkers would call into question a basic working assumption in sociolinguistics, that data collected in linguistic interviews reflect the typical linguistic behavior of informants. If the results of linguistic fieldwork are in part a function of different interviewers, then the data clearly do not represent typical linguistic behavior--that is, the kind of speech that informants use when they are not being observed by sociolinguists. In spite of the potential importance of interviewer effects on sociolinguistic data, few researchers have explored them in detail.},

This paper explores the synchrony and diachrony of differential object marking in Paraguayan Guaraní on the basis of a quantitative study of a corpus of naturally occurring data of the modern language and an investigation of object marking in a 17th-century catechism. We show that both animacy and topicality, but not definiteness, affect whether a direct object is marked in modern Guaraní, a finding that has implications for cross-linguistic theories of differential object marking, not all of which recognize topicality as a factor. We also find no categorical constraints on differential object marking in Guaraní, contrary to Bossong (1985b). Our study of the 17th-century catechism provides further support for Bossong's (1985b, 2009) claim that Guaraní did not have differential object marking when it came into contact with Spanish. The paper concludes with a discussion of the hypothesis that differential object marking in Guaraní resulted from contact with Spanish. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The Linguistic Review 23: 351–379, 2006a). This article reports on an experiment designed to test to degree to which exposure to the concept of a region can also influence perception. In order to invoke the concept, we exposed participants, who were all speakers of New Zealand English, to either stuffed toy kangaroos and koalas (associated with Australia) or stuffed toy kiwis (associated with New Zealand). Participants then completed a perception task in which they matched natural vowels produced by a male New Zealander to vowels from a synthesized continuum which ranged from raised and fronted Australian-like tokens to lowered and centralized New Zealand-like tokens. Our results indicate that perception of the vowels shifted depending on which set of toys the participants had seen. This supports models of speech perception in which linguistic and nonlinguistic information are intricately entwined.},

Listeners’ sensitivity to the realization of (ING) words embedded in sentences was tested under various conditions. Comprehenders demonstrated expectations about the grammatical category constraints conditioning the realization of (ING) even though such knowledge may not be very informative about word recognition (Experiment 1). As more reliable phonetic information was available, listeners weighted grammatical expectations less, favoring other cues in the signal (Experiments 2 and 3). Bridging a gap between psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic accounts of probabilistic conditioning, these results suggest that factors beyond utility for word recognition may contribute to the probabilistic monitoring of a variable, and underscore the opportunistic nature of the speech comprehension system, where listeners make use of whatever information they have to process the signal.},

Bilingualism was widely tolerated until the end of WWI, when speaking French in public was stigmatized. In the last 30 years, however, Louisiana has moved to preserve French by teaching it in all elementary schools. The emerging generation of French-English bilinguals is flourishing academically. It is argued that immersion programs encourage children to speak the target language with their teenaged peers \& that such programs need to be extended into middle school \& perhaps beyond. 55 References.

	abstract = {Even though there are increasing numbers of Early Partial Immersion (EPI) programs in Louisiana, there was no data available on the long-term impact of these programs. The purpose of this study is to delve into the experiences of 10 former immersion students in order to reveal their accounts and perceptions of their bilingual abilities, their language use patterns and language attitudes at the post-secondary level. In short, this study is to find out what former EPI students are doing, or are not doing with the target language at the post-secondary level. This dissertation focused on a diverse population of former French EPI students from two Louisiana parishes: St Martin Parish and Lafayette Parish who were enrolled at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette during the time of the study. A qualitative research design, incorporating ethnographic methods, was chosen to address the particular aims of the study to examine the immersion experiences and perspectives of these former EPI participants. These Louisiana students reveal a strong L2 foundation, but this foundation tends to weaken beyond immersion as there are fewer opportunities to increase and promote their French use. This study suggests that the overall essence of the immersion experience was good but challenging; there is an overall lack of language use carryover from immersion to post-secondary level. This study sought to reflect individual perspectives and offer to parents as well as immersion advocates and policymakers insight into some of the long-term impacts of French immersion at the post-secondary level.

The schools, which were the principal agent for the marginalization of these languages, have been called upon to reverse their action. This raises two questions in language planning. First, can schools assume this new function? Second, should revitalization be accomplished by developing standardized forms of minority regional languages or by using variable local forms? The two issues will be discussed in the context of the revitalization of Louisiana French (Cajun), the traditional vernacular of the majority of the French (or French-related) speakers in southwestern Louisiana. Two language planning issues in particular will be treated: the choice of a spelling and the elaboration of a standard norm for Cajun. Adapted from the source document},

This change is analyzed using transcriptions of free conversations \& oral translations by LCF speakers (N = 76) Ss were divided into three groups aged under 30, 30-54, \& 55+. Two kinds of changes are found in first person singular constructions: loss of emphatic or contrastive effect in the disjunctive pronoun moi 'me, myself', sometimes used as the subject replacing je 'I'; \& increasing occurrence of null subjects. Second person structures showed an increase in use of tu 'you' (informal singular) in polite contexts, a decrease in vous 'you' (polite singular) \& vous-autres 'you' (informal plural), \& elimination of most -ez verb endings. In the various 3rd person plurals, the pronoun ils 'they' \& virtually all subject-verb agreement were eliminated, younger speakers displayed a preference for using ca to designate 'they', \& the use of eusse \& eux-autres for 'they' was also in frequent use.

The source data employed are drawn from student term papers collected between November 1998 \& May 2000. The papers are narratives of family language history; many include transcripts of interviews students conducted with family members. A synthesis of the information in the papers reveals that what individuals attribute to the singular facts of family history in fact represent, when taken together, patterns of loss applicable not only to CF in general but to myriad minority languages around the world. These papers also reveal a patchwork of attitudes toward Cajun French rather than monolithic agreement on its value to the community; the sources \& consequences of these attitudes are explored. A central goal of the discussion of these data is to highlight the value of narrative in studies of language loss. Specifically demonstrated is the role of punishment as not simply one of multiple factors but as a critically important factor in explaining the decline of CF \& the lack of a stable bilingualism in the Cajun community. 14 References.

	abstract = {The English of bilingual Cajuns living in southern Louisiana has been described as an accented variety of English, the result of interference from French. To investigate this proposition, a variationist study of four features of Cajun English are presented: (1) the interdental fricatives /(theta), (eth)/ realized by the dental stops [t, d], (2) the failure to aspirate the stops /p, t, k/, (3) the monophthongization of /ai/, \& (4) vowel nasalization. The data for this study are taken from the Cajun French/English Sociolinguistic Survey; the survey has confirmed that English has become dominant in these communities over the last two generations. A subsample of 28 speakers, divided by gender into three age groups, is taken from St. Landry Parish. If interference from French is the source of these features of Cajun English, there would be a steady decrease in frequency over apparent time so that these vernacular features will be used more frequently by the older \& less frequently by the middle-aged \& least of all by the younger generation. The results of GoldVarb analysis of the variables show a complex interrelationship of age, gender, \& social network. All of the variables studied followed the expected pattern; the older generation use more of the vernacular variants than all others; the middle-aged dramatically decrease their use of the vernacular but the young generation exhibit a number of complex patterns in their use of the vernacular features. Interestingly the young follow the decreasing pattern for /p, t, k/, but they show a level of usage for the other variables closer to the older generation so that there is a v-shaped age pattern rather than a pattern showing a steady decrease of the accented features of Cajun English. It is argued that although the vernacular forms produced by the older group can be considered part of an ethnic accent, they play a very different role in the younger generation, which can be attributed both to French language attrition \& to the on-going blossoming of a Cajun cultural renaissance. Being Cajun is now socially \& economically advantageous; the younger generation, unlike the middle-aged, take pride in their Cajun identity. The functions of French for people under 40 years old have been significantly reduced so that it is now generally limited to the family domain \& even more restricted in that it is used primarily in speaking with older members of the extended family. Given this situation, the only linguistic way to signal "Cajunness" is left to English. 5 Tables, 4 Figures, 1 Map, 38 References. Adapted from the source document},

Much of the research on accommodation focuses on the standard—nonstandard or on the local—nonlocal dimension. There is notably little research into accommodation from forms that are indexical of a particular ethnic identity to forms that are indexical of another ethnic identity. This article takes up the question of accommodation toward African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and New York Latino English (NYLE) among white ethnic immigrants in New York City who affiliate with hip-hop culture. It provides evidence to support a view of accommodation that stems from a strong attitudinal orientation toward the group with which a speaker wants to associate.},

One peculiarity of ragga soca is the borrowing of Jamaican Creole English phonological features into the performance genre. Initially, there was much opposition to this genre as it challenged notions of Trinidadian identity and self. This paper considers the linguistic innovativeness of ragga soca artists, in particular, their use of Jamaican Creole English phonological borrowings, demonstrating that they have not only created a new performance genre, but have used Jamaican Creole English to mediate their Trinidadian identity.},

Numerous scholars maintain that the Japanese conflation of race with language establishes patterns of racial discrimination in which Japanese prefer not to use the Japanese language for inter-ethnic communication. Likewise, the Japanese language is rarely treated as a language of broader communication (i.e., global communication) by the Japanese. However, the recent development of the “language entertainment” genre of broadcast television actively challenges these stereotypes of Japanese ethnolinguistic identity. Furthermore, language mixing within Japanese popular music, especially mixing that results in “code ambiguation,” attempts to redefine ethnic identity by obscuring what language is used in pop music. These phenomena are interpreted according to possible ongoing changes of Japanese ethnolinguistic identity.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the construction of cultural identities through contemporary music from Madagascar, in particular the songs by Dama — singer-song-writer of the eponymous group of musicians- the Mahaleo. Specific focus is on the role that the discourses of and about popular Malagasy music play for the identity constructions of Malagasy people in Madagascar and abroad. Discussions about contemporary African music on the media and in the cultural studies literature, and the record industry’s own appropriation and commercialization of such music as generic ‘world music’ — tend to neglect the lyrics — and thus the often radical social critique — contained in these songs. Since much of African music is sung in languages not normally known to ‘Western’ audiences, their appreciation hinges on the vibrancy of rhythm and sound, to the exclusion of content. Yet to ‘home’ and ‘diasporic’ audiences, the texts are of huge significance. Our paper discusses the significance of language choice for popular music in Madagascar in the political movement of 1972 and its aftermath. We will also analyse in detail the lyrics of some typical songs from Mahaleo’s repertoire written by Dama. These will exemplify some of the ways in which the group attempts to encapsulate aspects of Malagasy every-day life, thus providing a cohesive link not only between several generations of Malagasies in Madagascar itself, but even more pronouncedly for those Malagasies who have left Madagascar and settled overseas. Finally, we will show the ways in which audiences create and perform ‘being Malagasy’ through the medium of their popular music, demonstrating the extent to which the project of ‘Mahaleo’ is being reflexively and consciously understood and taken up by their listeners.},

	abstract = {AbstractIn a multilingual Lapland, globalization processes have various sociolinguistic effects. A good example is a change in the functions and values of the indigenous Sámi languages. The once solid community languages were pushed in the margins of the nation states in the early twentieth century. Today, Sámi linguistic and other semiotic resources are used not only for communication and building an indigenous community, but they function also as a commodity in global music markets and tourism, or as a resource for creative identity performance. This kind of a sociolinguistic change calls for an investigation that overcomes the macro–micro gap and concepts that address movements, diversity, and multiplicity in this multilingual situation. To this end, I fuse ethnographic and discourse analytical approaches in an attempt to track movements and conditions of Sámi resource mobility. The data examined in this article comprise multimodal discourse data (photographs, interviews, texts) and observations and recordings from ethnographic fieldwork in the North Calotte area of Lapland.},

We question these assumptions on several grounds. First, 'grammar' is arguably distinct from the processes driving speech production. Second, the role of grammar is mediated by the variable, poly-idiolectal repertoires of bilingual speakers. Third, in many instances of CS the notion of a 'base' system is either irrelevant, or fails to explain the facts. Fourth, sociolinguistic factors frequently override 'grammatical' factors, as evidence from the same language pairs in different settings has shown. No principles proposed to date account for all the facts, and it seems unlikely that 'grammar', as conventionally conceived, can provide definitive answers. We conclude that rather than seeking universal, predictive grammatical rules, research on CS should focus on the variability of bilingual grammars.},

The community of practice provides a useful alternative to the speech-community model, which has limitations for language and gender researchers in particular. As an ethnographic, activity-based approach, the community of practice is of special value to researchers in language and gender because of its compatibility with current theories of identity. An extension of the community of practice allows identities to be explained as the result of positive and negative identity practices rather than as fixed social categories, as in the speech-community model. The frame-work is used here to analyze the linguistic practices associated with an un-examined social identity, the nerd, and to illustrate how members of a local community of female nerds at a US high school negotiate gender and other aspects of their identities through practice.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

The partial separation between classes, racial groups and generations seems to affect linguistic change much as physical and political divisions do. Abstracting gender from other aspects of social identity leads to premature generalization even about normative conceptions of femaleness and maleness.},

He was a pioneer of the sociolinguist movement, striving to find ways to connect language and speech to human relations and anthropological study. Within this collection of essays, the reader will find varied studies of pidgin and creole languages by academics considered leaders in their field, particularly at this time. The topics of these essays range from those exploring the employment of pidgin languages in specific territories, such as Vietnam, the West Indies and the US, to those essays looking at the formation and hybridization of pidgin and creole languages generally.},

We develop the mathematical background for these variable rules, which were introduced by Labov, and we apply the theory and methodology to examples from Spanish, French, and English. The data consist of relative frequencies of rule application for different types of input string, and they provide a check on the frequencies predicted by variable rules. This study supports the hypothesis that the various features in rule structural descriptions tend to act independently, in the statistical sense, on rule probabilities. The analytic framework for variable rules is easily and naturally extendable to take into account the effect of sociolinguistic and stylistic features on application frequencies.},

	abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

The notion 'rule of grammar' is enlarged to include the formal treatment of inherent variation as a part of linguistic structure. Furthermore, a model is presented for the decisive solution of abstract questions of rule form and rule relations, based upon the direct study of linguistic behavior.},

While the linguistic categories are generally well-defined and there are sufficient tokens for further definition based on mathematical manipulation, the social characteristics such as socioeconomic class or ethnicity are neither. The familiar problem of grouping speakers by such sociological characteristics prior to quantitative analysis is addressed and an alternative solution -- principal components analysis -- is suggested. Principal components analysis is used here as a heuristic for grouping speakers solely on the basis of linguistic behaviour; the groups thus defined can then be described according to sociological characteristics. In addition, by naming the principal components, the major linguistic and social dimensions of the variation in the data can be identified. Principal components analysis was applied to vowel variation data collected as part of a sociolinguistic survey of English in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.},

Individual-level studies (n=4) are reviewed that investigate the risks and benefits of owning a personal or household firearm. The research suggests that households with firearms are at higher risk for homicide, and there is no net beneficial effect of firearm ownership. No longitudinal cohort study seems to have investigated the association between a gun in the home and homicide. Two groups of ecological studies are reviewed, those comparing multiple countries and those focused solely on the United States. Results from the cross-sectional international studies (n=7) typically show that in high-income countries with more firearms, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide. Time series (n=10) and cross-sectional studies (n=9) of U.S. cities, states, and regions and for the United States as a whole, generally find a statistically significant gun prevalence–homicide association. None of the studies prove causation, but the available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that increased gun prevalence increases the homicide rate.},

Study 2 manipulated social network size by randomly assigning participants to learn novel evaluative words as used by two (small network) versus eight (large network) speakers. It replicated the finding from Study 1, showing that those exposed to a larger social network were better at comprehending the valence of product reviews containing the novel words that were written by novel speakers. Together, these studies show that the size of one's social network can influence success at language comprehension.

According to this principle, people with larger social networks should give less weight to new incoming information, and should therefore be less susceptible to the influence of new speakers. This paper tests this prediction, and shows that speakers with smaller social networks indeed have more malleable linguistic representations. In particular, they are more likely to adjust their lexical boundary following exposure to a new speaker. Experiment 2 uses computational simulations to test whether this greater malleability could lead people with smaller social networks to be important for the propagation of linguistic change despite the fact that they interact with fewer people. The results indicate that when innovators were connected with people with smaller rather than larger social networks, the population exhibited greater and faster diffusion. Together these experiments show that the properties of people’s social networks can influence individuals’ learning and use as well as linguistic phenomena at the community level.},

	abstract = {In a recent paper we have discussed certain general principles underlying the determination of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses, but the method of approach did not involve any detailed consideration of the question of a priori probability. We propose now to consider more fully the bearing of the earlier results on this question and in particular to discuss what statements of value to the statistician in reaching his final judgment can be made from an analysis of observed data, which would not be modified by any change in the probabilities a priori. In dealing with the problem of statistical estimation, R. A. Fisher has shown how, under certain conditions, what may be described as rules of behaviour can be employed which will lead to results independent of these probabilities; in this connection he has discussed the important conception of what he terms fiducial limits. But the testing of statistical hypotheses cannot be treated as a problem in estimation, and it is necessary to discuss afresh in what sense tests can be employed which are independent of a priori probability laws.},

In unsettled cultural periods, explicit ideologies directly govern action, but structural opportunities for action determine which among competing ideologies survive in the long run.

Mitchell Duneier spent much of five years in their company: working at their vending tables, hearing their stories, and observing the roles they play. He came away convinced that these men, in their struggles to better themselves, are fundamental to the well-being of the city.Featuring Ovie Carter's powerful photographs, an insightful Afterword by longtime book vendor Hakim Hasan, and a new Epilogue, Sidewalk is already recognized as the best book about street life since Jane Jacobs's The Death and Life of Great American Cities.},

Involved in this are two principal technical-aesthetic-axiological-semiotic types: music in music and music about music. There are various ways of exploting pre-existent material (ante-facti or prae-facti) or stylistic ideas. Governing these are the main sources of borrowings; the polysemic complexity of interrelations and dialogues between loan-music and the music absorbing it (a dialectical network). Musical quotations have various functions, their context an essential factor in conditioning signification: Some quotations are context-sensitive, some context-free. There are negative and positive reasons for employing quotations, and several types of quotation: parole quotation, langue quotation, quotation-symbol, crypto-quotation, hetero-codal quotation, quotation-signature, as well as collage. Numerous illustrations are given, mainly from 20th-century music.},

	abstract = {George Crumb's Black Angels: Thirteen Images from the Dark Land for Electric String Quartet (1970) are individually original, but also representative for compositional practices for the twentieth century. As in his other compositions, Crumb has integrated musical quotations and various musical styles, including a web of references that extend into other media in such a way that they form an indispensable part of the basic construction of the work: these components form part of its newness. In Black Angels the composer—among other well-known pieces of music—quotes the medieval `Dies irae' sequence and the second movement of Schubert's string quartet in D minor (D. 810). The musical and intermedial references are framed with striking modernistic sounds exploring instrumental possibilities far beyond the traditional, thus creating a framework of extreme contrasts. The paper will contextualize, analyze and interpret Black Angels—which the composer explicitly linked to the Vietnam War—in a broad context of music, intermediality, religious symbolism, and cultural memory, pointing to the cultural meaning of this technique of recontextualization as a break with, as well as a continuation of, modernity.},

Several references to Elgar's Violin Concerto are highlighted in the first and second movements of the quartet, and broader stylistic referencesto Dvořák and Debussy are also identified. Explanations are suggested for these references, based on parallels drawn between Bax's musical practice in this work, the composer's early reception, and his prose writings in the Musical Standard and Musical Herald, which discussed ‘artistic good faith’, musical influence and the difficulties of creating a national style in British music.},

	abstract = {Critical evaluations of audio mash‐ups and remixes tend to congregate around two poles. On the one hand, these often clever re‐combinations of recorded music are celebrated as innovative and creative interventions in the material of bland commodity culture. On the other hand, they are often reviled as derivative, inauthentic, and illegal because they do nothing more than appropriate and reconfigure the intellectual property of others. This essay does not side with either position but identifies and critiques the common understanding and fundamental assumptions that make these two, opposed positions possible in the first place. The investigation of this matter is divided into two main parts. The first considers the traditional understanding of technologically enabled reproduction and the often unquestioned value it invests in the concept of originality. It does so by beginning with a somewhat unlikely source, Plato's Phaedrus—a dialogue that, it is argued, articulates the original concept of originality that both determines and is reproduced in the theories and practices of sound recording. The second part of the essay demonstrates how the audio mash‐up deliberately intervenes in this tradition, advancing a fundamental challenge to the original understanding and privilege of originality. In making this argument, however, the essay does not endeavor to position the mash‐up as anything unique or innovative. Instead, it demonstrates how mash‐ups, true to their thoroughly derivative nature, plunder, reuse, and remix anomalies that are already available in and constitutive of recorded music.},

	abstract = {If listening in adverse conditions is hard, then listening in a foreign language is doubly so: non-native listeners have to cope with both imperfect signals and imperfect knowledge. Comparison of native and non-native listener performance in speech-in-noise tasks helps to clarify the role of prior linguistic experience in speech perception, and, more directly, contributes to an understanding of the problems faced by language learners in everyday listening situations. This article reviews experimental studies on non-native listening in adverse conditions, organised around three principal contributory factors: the task facing listeners, the effect of adverse conditions on speech, and the differences among listener populations. Based on a comprehensive tabulation of key studies, we identify robust findings, research trends and gaps in current knowledge.},

	abstract = {This thesis is meant to further our understanding of an important variable in speech communication, fundamental frequency (F0). Towards this goal, I investigated F0 perturbation by consonants and lexical tone restoration in continuous speech of Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin is atone language and its lexical tones have relatively stable F0 patterns, which offer good references for studying various effects on surface F0, contours. F0 perturbation by consonants is an involuntary F0 variation during speech production. The clarification of involuntary effects on pitch movements can provide a baseline for studying the communicative factors and shed light on underlying mechanisms of articulatory constraints. By analyzing the main effect of consonant perturbation on F0, I found that Mandarin voiceless consonants give rise to higher F0 onsets in the following vowel as opposed to nasal consonants, with aspirated stops associated with lower values than their unaspirated cognates. By analyzing the interaction of consonant perturbation with lexical tone and tonal coarticulation on F0 I proposed that this perturbation effect is attributable to myoelastic factors, as well as aerodynamic factors. The analyses of interaction also show that the effect of consonant perturbation is local and it does not change the underlying pitch targets of lexical tones or the performance of tonal coarticulation. Rather, it is superimposed onto the F0 contours resulting from known contextual tonal variations without altering the general course of the F0 movements. The above findings of diverse F0 variations in speech production may raise the question as to how those F0 variations operate in speech perception. Based on the broad distribution of tonal information in the speech signal, I hypothesized that F0, may function as a robust acoustic cue in auditory compensation and tested this hypothesis with experiments on phonemic restoration. The important function of F0 in auditory compensation is confirmed by the evidence that contextual tonal variations resulting from carryover effects can lead to restoration of lexical tones. This finding suggests the importance of taking advantage of the robustness of the F0 cue in speech technology so that ASR systems can be applied to real-life environments.},

The authors first outline how selective perceptual processes develop and become automatized in infant/child L1 acquisition and introduce a number of studies that illustrate the range of difficulty with respect to adult listeners; abilities to perceive nonnative sound contrasts. Next, the authors provide a detailed discussion of methodological frameworks, including types of experimental tasks, for perception research. Within this context, the experimental paradigms are illustrated and critically evaluated. Strange and Shafer go on to provide an overview of current models of L2 speech perception, including the Native Language Magnet Model, the Perceptual Assimilation Model and Speech Learning Model, and discuss major theoretical issues, such as cross-language phonetic similarity. In addition, they address recent neurobiological approaches to the study of L2 speech perception, including electrophysiological measures of discrimination. They conclude their chapter by presenting a 'tetrahedral model' that provides a framework for considering several experimental variables for the design, interpretation and evaluation of L2 speech perception studies.

This is followed by a parallel, yet orthogonal classification of ACs based on the locus of their effect: Perceptual processes, mental representations, attention, and memory functions. We then review the added value that ACs provide for theories of speech recognition, with a focus on fundamental themes in psycholinguistics: Content and format of lexical representations, time-course of lexical access, word segmentation, feed-back in speech perception and recognition, lexical-semantic integration, interface between the speech system and general cognition, neuroanatomical organisation of speech processing.

For example, when the initial phoneme of a word is obliterated and replaced with noise, listeners hear it as intact provided there is semantic context. We modified this phonemic restoration paradigm by masking (not obliterating) the initial phoneme of a target word and presenting it within a carrier phrase which was informative (I), uninformative (U), or misinformative (M). Bias in favor of top-down context was measured as the extent to which M trials mislead listeners into reporting a target word other than that which was presented (relative to U trials that have irrelevant top-down semantic context). Forty-one participants (20 men) completed 600 test trials (300 delayed report of the phrase, 300 forced choice). Relative to the U condition, women were more affected by both the I and M cues than men, at certain levels of audibility during the forced choice condition. Moreover, the semantic strength of the I carrier phrases was correlated with the rate of correct reports of the target words in women but not in men. This suggests that women can be more affected by top-down semantic context than men.},

	abstract = {In this model, speech perception is characterized as a purposeful, information-seeking activity whereby adult listeners detect the most reliable acoustic parameters that specify phonetic segments and sequences in their native language (L1), using highly over-learned selective perception routines. In laboratory perceptual tasks, differentiation of L1 phonetic contrasts is rapid and robust even in suboptimal listening conditions and even when the listeners focus on other levels of language structure, or indeed on another task. In contrast, late second language (L2) learners must employ greater attentional resources in order to extract sufficient information to differentiate phonetic contrasts that do not occur in their native language. Phonetic and phonological modes of speech perception are described, which can be tapped in the laboratory by manipulations of stimulus complexity and task demands. These experimental manipulations reveal complex interactions between the linguistic experience of listeners and phonetic similarity relationships between L1 and L2 phonological inventories. Illustrative experimental evidence from my studies of vowel perception using perceptual assimilation (cross-language identification), speeded discrimination, discrimination in speech babble, and brain indices of discrimination (MMN) are presented to provide operational definitions of these concepts. Similarities and differences from other current theories of cross-language and L2 speech perception are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]},

	abstract = {In phonemic restoration, intelligibility of interrupted speech is enhanced when noise fills the speech gaps. When the broadband envelope of missing speech amplitude modulates the intervening noise, intelligibility is even better. However, this phenomenon represents a perceptual failure: The amplitude modulation, a noise feature, is misattributed to the speech. Experiments explored whether object formation influences how information in the speech gaps is perceptually allocated. Experiment 1 replicates the finding that intelligibility is enhanced when speech-modulated noise rather than unmodulated noise is presented in the gaps. In Experiment 2, interrupted speech was presented diotically, but intervening noises were presented either diotically or with an interaural time difference leading in the right ear, causing the noises to be perceived to the side of the listener. When speech-modulated noise and speech are perceived from different directions, intelligibility is no longer enhanced by the modulation. However, perceived location has no effect for unmodulated noise, which contains no speech-derived information. Results suggest that enhancing object formation reduces misallocation of acoustic features across objects, and demonstrate that our ability to understand noisy speech depends on a cascade of interacting processes, including glimpsing sensory inputs, grouping sensory inputs into objects, and resolving ambiguity through top-down knowledge.},

	abstract = {The reliability of the ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) has not been reported since ACTFL revised its speaking proficiency guidelines in 1999. Reliability data for assessments should be reported periodically to provide users with enough information to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the assessment. This study provided the most comprehensive analysis of ACTFL OPI reliability to date, reporting interrater consistency and agreement data for 19 different languages. Overall, the interrater reliability of the ACTFL OPI was found to be very high. These results demonstrate the importance of using an OPI assessment program that has a well-designed interview process, a well-articulated set of criteria for proficiency determination, a solid rater training program, and an experienced cadre of testers. Based on the data reported, educators and employers who use the ACTFL OPI can expect reliable results and use the scores generated from the testing process with increased confidence. Recommendations for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document},

This study demonstrates that the effect is reversed when sounds are presented in a realistically simulated reverberant room (broadband T60 = 1.1 s): intelligibility is greater for silent interruptions than for interruptions by unmodulated noise. Additional results suggest that the reversal is primarily due to filling silent intervals with reverberant energy from the speech signal.},

	abstract = {Background: There is strong evidence that bilinguals have a deficit in speech perception for their second language compared with monolingual speakers under unfavourable listening conditions (e.g., noise or reverberation), despite performing similarly to monolingual speakers under quiet conditions. This deficit persists for speakers highly proficient in their second language and is greater in those who learned the language later in life. These findings have important educational implications because the number of multilingual children is increasing worldwide, and many of these children are being taught in their non-native language under poor classroom acoustic conditions. Aims: The performance of monolingual, bilingual and trilingual speakers on an English speech perception task was examined in both quiet and noisy conditions. Trilingual performance was compared with that of monolingual and bilingual speakers. Methods \& Procedures: Monolingual speakers of English and early bilingual and trilingual speakers (i.e., acquired English as a second/third language before the age of 6 years) were recruited. Their fluency in English was tested by interview and by a questionnaire assessing their knowledge and use of the language. Audiological evaluation confirmed normal hearing in all participants. English speech perception was tested in quiet and in different levels of noise (50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 dB SPL) using the Speech Perception in Noise (SPIN) Test. Outcomes \& Results: Bilingual and trilingual listeners performed similarly to monolingual listeners in quiet conditions, but their performance declined more rapidly in noise and was significantly poorer at 65 and 70 dB SPL. Trilingual listeners performed less well than bilinguals at these noise levels, but not significantly so. A subgroup of five bilingual speakers who learned Arabic and English simultaneously since birth were poorer at higher levels of noise than monolinguals, but not significantly so. Conclusions \& Implications: The results replicate previous findings of poorer speech perception in noise with bilingual speakers compared with monolinguals and extend the findings to trilingual speakers.

	abstract = {Behavioral research has documented that background noise impacts speech perception for non-native speakers more than for native speakers, even when the non-native language is acquired at an early age and is currently the dominant language of use. Neurophysiological studies comparing language processing in quiet for the bilingual and monolingual brain are plentiful; however the impact of noise on neural markers associated with semantic processing (i.e. PN/N400) for these groups has not been compared. The present study measured auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) to English words using a semantic priming paradigm for two groups of young adults: monolingual speakers of English and highly proficient bilingual speakers of Spanish/English. Participants listened to English word triplets (S1, S2, S3); they were instructed to decide if the third word was semantically related to either of the preceding words. Analyses of ERP waveforms time-locked to S1 and S2 provided an opportunity to evaluate how the brain processes semantic relationships between words without interference from a simultaneous overt response. Results confirmed essentially equivalent neural patterns of semantic processing of word triplets between groups under ideal listening conditions. In the presence of background babble, distinct differences between group activation patterns were evident at posterior electrode sites, however results also indicated widespread similarities between monolingual and bilingual listeners. In particular, both groups evoked interesting changes in anterior neural activity when processing target words (related or unrelated to a preceding word) compared to when processing the initial prime words. The noise condition also elicited significant interaction effects of listening condition and group, suggesting that background babble impacts neural responses associated with semantic processing differently for monolinguals versus highly proficient bilingual speakers. Implications of these findings are discussed in relationship to existing literature and the need for further study.

	abstract = {Speech perception rarely takes place in quiet environments, and for people with hearing impairment, difficulty understanding speech in noisy conditions is often the primary complaint. However, neither traditional clinical hearing tests nor a person's ability to understand speech in quiet can adequately predict the amount of trouble s/he will have in noise. Noise is also more detrimental to speech understanding for non-native and bilingual listeners than for monolingual listeners of a given language. This variability in performance within and across clinical and linguistic populations suggests that speech intelligibility in noise is modulated by both the auditory system and by experience-related cognitive factors such as a person's language background. Thus far, most research efforts have been directed toward auditory function; my dissertation aims to develop a fuller understanding of the particularly linguistic aspects of speech-in-noise perception. Building on the insight that speech-in-noise intelligibility may be modulated by listener experience, this dissertation has two primary aims: 1) to expand our understanding of the relationship between language experience and speech intelligibility in speech noise and 2) to identify parameters of auditory training that can facilitate speech-in-speech intelligibility. The first aim was addressed by assessing English sentence intelligibility in English and Mandarin babble by monolingual English speakers and non-native speakers of English whose native language is Mandarin. Results showed that both groups experienced greater difficulty in English versus Mandarin babble, but that Mandarin listeners received a smaller release from masking in Mandarin babble relative to English babble. These findings indicate that both the similarity between the target and the noise and the language experience of the listener contribute to the masking imposed by speech noise. The second aim was addressed with a training study, in which listeners received speech-in-noise training in speech-shaped noise, Mandarin babble, or English babble. Post-test performance showed that listeners were able to take advantage of target talker familiarity, and, after babble training, that they improved most in coping with the babble language in which they were trained. Speech-in-noise training, therefore, can enhance processes associated with both "tuning in" to speech targets and "tuning out" speech noise.

Specifically, we asked how native and non-native Hebrew speaking listeners perceive accented and native-accented Hebrew speech. To achieve this goal we used the gating paradigm to explore the ability of healthy late fluent bilinguals (Russian and Arabic native speakers) to recognize words in L2 (Hebrew) when they were spoken in an accent like their own, a native accent (Hebrew speakers), or another foreign accent (American accent). The data revealed that for Hebrew speakers, there was no effect of accent, whereas for the two bilingual groups (Russian and Arabic native speakers), stimuli with an accent like their own and the native Hebrew accent, required significantly less phonological information than the other foreign accents. The results support the hypothesis that phonological assimilation works in a similar manner in these two different groups.},

	abstract = {This study examined Australian English (AE) \& Thai-English bilingual (TE) speakers' ability to perceive word-final stops in their native \& non-native languages. In the perception experiment, the TE listeners were able to discriminate stop contrasts differing only in place of articulation (/p/-/t/, /p/-/k/, /t/-/k/) in both English \& Thai accurately, but the AE listeners' discrimination was accurate only for English. The listeners' discrimination accuracy was differentially influenced by the type of stop contrast they heard. The Thai /p/-/t/ contrast was most discriminable for both groups of listeners, in particular, the AE listeners. Acoustic analyses of the Thai stimuli presented in the perception experiment were conducted in order to search for cues that led to different response patterns for the AE \& TE listeners. There was a clear effect of the final stop on the formant trajectories of /a/ \& /u/, suggesting that these acoustic differences may be audible to the listeners. The results provide further evidence that first language (L1) transfer alone is insufficient to account for listeners' response patterns in cross-language speech perception \& that it is necessary to take into account phonetic realization of sounds \&/or the amount of acoustic information contained in the speech signal to predict accuracy with which sound contrasts are discriminated.

	abstract = {Different speakers may pronounce the same sounds very differently (with native or non-native accents, or atypical variants like lisps); and yet listeners have little difficulty perceiving speech accurately, especially after a bit of experience with a particular speaker. Recent research on perceptual learning suggests that listeners adjust their preexisting phonetic categories to accommodate speakers' pronunciations of those phonemes (Norris, McQueen \& Cutler, 2003). But the underlying processes that enable such learning, and the implications for linguistic representation, are poorly understood. In a series of experiments, I used variations on the perceptual learning paradigm to examine these issues. Listeners were exposed to a particular person's speech and later tested on their perception of critical aspects of that speech. The first three experiments investigated the nature of perceptual learning: Is learning specific to the speakers and phonemes heard during exposure? Does it result in temporary adaptations or enduring representational changes? Can listeners adjust to several speakers simultaneously? Taken together, Experiments 1-3 suggest that perceptual experience leads to very different learning for different types of phonemes. For phonemes that vary primarily on a spectral dimension, perceptual learning is very robust (shifts of approximately 15\%), long-lasting (the shifts are just as large 25 minutes later, even with intervening speech input), and speaker-specific. For such phonemes, the perceptual system is able to maintain several different representations simultaneously. In contrast, for sounds that vary on a timing dimension, perceptual learning is less robust (shifts of 4-5\%), generalizes to new speakers and new phonemes, and results in representations that need to be re-adjusted whenever a new pronunciation is encountered. In Experiments 4 and 5, I extended the study of perceptual learning to dialectal variations in pronunciation, and to production. The results suggest that the perceptual system handles dialectal variation quite differently than idiosyncratic variation: dialectal variation does not result in perceptual learning. Further, while listeners' productions can change to reflect speech they have just heard, their productions do not appear to change to reflect speech they have previously adjusted to (perceptually). This suggests that phonemic representations may not be shared by the perceptual and production systems.},

This study aimed to examine whether poor perception by NNLs is due to their limited usage of the contextual information or their abilities in processing acoustic‐phonetic signals, by investigating Chinese listeners’ ability in perceiving English sentences in varying linguistic contexts, such as semantic and syntactic cues, under different listening conditions. Sentences differing in degrees of semantic or syntactic acceptability produced by NSs of English were judged a different group of naive NSs of English on degrees of acceptability. All sentences were digitized and masked with white and babble noises with different signal‐to‐noise ratios (−4 and −8 dB). Listeners from three language backgrounds were recruited. Results showed that semantic and syntactic cues, as well as listening conditions, exhibited different degrees of facilitation in rewriting of keywords. Chinese speakers benefited more from marked syntactic structures, whereas English speakers found marked semantic contexts more facilitating.},

	abstract = {The aim of this dissertation was to assess the perception of speech, voice and music in three groups of patients fit with cochlear implants. The patients in one group used the Advanced Bionics CII Bionic Ear system and the Hi-Resolution speech coding strategy. The patients in a second group used the Cochlear Corporation Esprit 3G processor and Advanced Combination Encoder speech coding strategy. The patients in a third group used the Med El Combi40+ system and CIS speech coding strategy. At issue was whether the different implant systems provided different levels of speech, voice or music recognition for patients. The results of Experiment 1 indicated that (i) patients can achieve high levels of speech understanding in quiet backgrounds, (ii) patients experience difficulty when speech is presented in noise backgrounds or at low levels, and (iii) patients achieved higher levels of speech understanding when speech was cued by information in the amplitude envelope than when speech was cued by information in the spectral domain. Differences in group mean performance were observed on tests of synthetic vowel recognition, the recognition of speech in noise and the recognition of speech at low levels. The pattern of results suggested that between-device differences in input dynamic range were responsible for most of time between-device differences in performance. In Experiment 2 the input dynamic range was increased from 30 to 40 dB in the 3C speech processor. The outcome was a significant interaction between device setting and performance in difficult listening situations. Increasing input dynamic range improved performance at low levels but degraded performance in noise. In Experiment 3 the input dynamic range was varied over the range 30-60 dB in the CII Bionic Ear system. The outcome was a significant increase in speech understanding at low levels and an increase in speech understanding in noise. The different results for patients fit with time 3G and CII system were likely due to differences in the compression functions used to expand input dynamic range in the two devices.},

Current models attempting to accomplish acoustic restoration of phonemes, however, use only temporal continuity and produce poor restoration of unvoiced phonemes, and are also limited in their ability to restore voiced phonemes. We present a schema-based model for phonemic restoration. The model employs a missing data speech recognition system to decode speech based on intact portions and activates word templates corresponding to the words containing the masked phonemes. An activated template is dynamically time warped to the noisy word and is then used to restore the speech frames corresponding to the masked phoneme, thereby synthesizing it. The model is able to restore both voiced and unvoiced phonemes with a high degree of naturalness. Systematic testing shows that this model outperforms a Kalman-filter based model.},

	abstract = {How do the laminar circuits of neocortex learn categories that can support conscious percepts of speech and language? How do learned speech categories become selectively tuned to different temporal sequences of speech items that are stored in short-term working memory in real time? How does the brain use resonant feedback between working memories and learned categories to restore information that is occluded by noise using the context of a word or sentence? A model is developed to simulate how multiple laminar cortical processing stages interact to support a conscious speech percept. In particular, acoustic features are unitized into acoustic items. These items activate representations in an item-and-order, or competitive queuing, sequential short-term working memory. The sequence of stored working memory items interacts reciprocally with unitized representations of item sequences, also called list categories or chunks, in a multiple-scale categorization network, called a masking field, that is capable of weighing the evidence for groupings of variable-length sequences of items as they are stored in the working memory through time. List chunks represent the most predictive item groupings at any time. These bottom-up and top-down interactions between auditory features, working memory, and list chunks generate a resonant wave of activation whose attended features embody consciously heard percepts, notably the completed percepts that can form even when acoustic information may be missing or occluded by noise. This occurs in the auditory illusion known as phonemic restoration, even if the disambiguating speech context occurs after the occluding noise. This thesis provides the first explanation and simulation of how phonemic restoration arises in a laminar cortical hierarchy. It also develops a masking field that learns to respond robustly to input patterns from working memory as they unfold in time. Notably, for a given number of input items, all possible ordered sets of these items up to a fixed length can be learned. Both unsupervised and supervised learning simulations are provided. Supervised learning does not require as many list chunks to learn arbitrary sequences. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

	abstract = {We present a schema-based model for phonemic restoration. The model employs missing-data ASR to decode speech based on unmasked portions and activates word templates that contain the masked phoneme via dynamic time warping. An activated template is then used to restore the masked phoneme. A systematic evaluation shows that the model is able to restore both voiced and unvoiced phonemes with a spectral quality close to that of original phonemes. Missing-data ASR relies on a binary mask generated by bottom-up CASA to label the speech-dominant time- frequency (T-F) regions of a noisy mixture as reliable and the rest as unreliable. However, errors in mask estimation cause degradation in recognition accuracy. Hence, we propose a two-pass ASR system that performs segregation and recognition in tandem. In the first pass, an n-best lattice, consistent with bottom-up speech separation, is generated. The lattice is then re-scored using a model-based hypothesis test to improve mask estimation and recognition accuracy concurrently. This two-pass system leads to significant improvement in recognition performance. By combining a monaural CASA system with missing-data ASR, we present a model that simulates listeners' ability to attend to a target speaker when degraded by the effects of energetic and informational masking in multitalker environments. Energetic masking refers to the phenomenon that a stronger signal masks a weaker one within a critical band. Informational masking occurs when the listener is unable to segregate target from interference. Missing-data ASR is used to account for energetic masking. The effects of informational masking are modeled by the output degradation of the CASA system in binary mask estimation. The model successfully simulates several quantitative aspects of listener performance including the differential effects of energetic and informational masking on multitalker perception. While missing-data ASR performs well on small vocabulary tasks, previous studies have not examined the effect of vocabulary size. In this dissertation, we investigate the performance of the missing-data ASR on a larger vocabulary task and compare its results to those of conventional ASR. For conventional ASR, we extract the speech signal from a noisy mixture by estimating a Wiener filter based on estimated interaural time and intensity differences within a T-F unit. For missing-data ASR, the same estimation is used to produce a binary T-F mask. We find that while missing-data recognition outperforms conventional ASR on a small vocabulary task, the performance of conventional ASR is significantly better when the vocabulary size is increased.},

	abstract = {Auditory closure (AC) is an aspect of auditory processing that is crucial for understanding speech in background noise. It is a set of abilities that allows listeners to understand speech in the absence of important information, both spectral and temporal. AC is evaluated using monaural low-redundancy speech tasks: low-pass filtered words (LPFW), time-compressed words (TCW), and words- in-noise (WiN). Although not previously used, phonemic restoration with words (PhRW) is also a speech task that has been proposed as a measure of AC. In the present study, four tasks of AC, that are listed above, were used to evaluate AC skills in 50 adult females with normal hearing. Using pair-wise correlations, there were no significant relationships among LPFW, TCW, and WiN. As a result, these three tasks were considered to be independent components of AC that represented the AC abilities of spectral reconstruction, temporal resolution, and auditory induction, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis with LFPW, TCW, and WiN as variables revealed that PhRW is accomplished using temporal resolution. The findings of this study show that no single task of AC is representative of the entire process and that further research is warranted to more completely define the skills that make AC possible.},

	abstract = {Perception of a phoneme may occur even when the speech sound is missing (e.g., when an extraneous noise replaces the sound). This phenomenon, called phonemic restoration, has been observed to depend on the type of distortion. It requires a replacing sound that provides acoustic input to the auditory system, since the restoration has not been found when a speech sound was replaced by silence. We examined the brain activation underlying speech processing when the word's initial phoneme was completely replaced by a silent gap. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction times (RTs) were measured as indicators of semantic processing of sentence final words. Slower voice onset times during repetition of the manipulated words as compared to normal words indicated increased difficulty in retrieving their meaning. The N400, which is related to the increased demands of the semantic integration of words, was elicited by less expected words as compared to highly expected ones. For manipulated words, the N400 was elicited at the same latency than for normal words, with respect to the onset of the remaining word fragment. The amplitude of the N400 was not increased, nor did it last longer, thereby indicating successful retrieval of the word's meaning based on the semantic context and remaining phonetic information. Thus, semantic retrieval does not seem to require the word's initial phoneme to be present in a sentence context. The results suggest that both context-driven expectancy (top–down) and stimulus-driven processes (bottom–up) are utilized in word processing and contribute to the overall N400 response.},

This study compared English and Spanish listeners' perceptions of English intervocalic consonants as a function of masker type. Three maskers (stationary noise, multitalker babble, and competing speech) provided varying amounts of energetic and informational masking. Competing English and Spanish speech maskers were used to examine the effect of masker language. Non-native performance fell short of that of native listeners in quiet, but a larger performance differential was found for all masking conditions. Both groups performed better in competing speech than in stationary noise, and both suffered most in babble. Since babble is a less effective energetic masker than stationary noise, these results suggest that non-native listeners are more adversely affected by both energetic and informational masking. A strong correlation was found between non-native performance in quiet and degree of deterioration in noise, suggesting that non-native phonetic category learning can be fragile. A small effect of language background was evident: English listeners performed better when the competing speech was Spanish.},

	abstract = {This study, based on Pierre Bourdieu's theory of linguistic domination and social relations of power, emphasizes the role of the school system in the reproduction, imposition, and inculcation of a legitimate dominant language to the detriment of minority languages. In Louisiana, schools have played a decisive role in language maintenance. Language of schooling has been a site of struggle for political and social domination. Two educational models, French and Anglo-American, conflicted over time for their principles, values, methods, and language use. During the colonization, French religious and private schools, designated for Creole elite, contributed to the reproduction and promotion of the French language. After Louisiana was purchased by the United States in 1803 and the American public education system was introduced in 1847, the French schools gradually assimilated into the American model. Educational systems suppressed French and promoted Americanization by imposing English as a symbolic power. The use of French was officially prohibited in public primary schools from 1921 to 1968. Formerly dominant, French has become a declining minority language. In 1968, Louisiana officially became a bilingual state. With the expansion of the French renaissance movement and the foundation of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), schools have become the main agent for revitalizing the French language. However, this bilingualism is not institutionalized de facto. Louisiana is in a diglossic situation, where the second official language, French, has a lower status than English. According to the census, the number of French speakers (those who speak French at home) is decreasing steadily (by 24\% in 1990-2000). On the other hand, the linguistic variety valued in the schools is Standard French, in detriment of Cajun French and Louisiana French Creole, spoken in South Louisiana. The integration of these vernaculars in the school curriculum becomes a crucial factor for the preservation of the rich cultural and linguistic heritage of Franco-Louisianians. Schools, along with other social agents (family, community, church, media), have yet a mission to accomplish in order to prevent the decline of the French language as an integral part of ethnic identity.},

In addition, by setting up standard French as the norm, CODOFIL devalues regional dialects, neglecting to consult the population concerned. Four strategies for teaching Louisiana Cajun French \& Creole dialects in schools are reviewed: (1) teaching a normalized form of the vernaculars, assuming a knowledge of Standard French; (2) a diglossic model, which is contrasted to the Swiss High/Low German diglossic relationship; (3) bilingual instruction, an impractical approach given the lack of norms \& the fact that most native Louisianans are Anglophones; \& (4) introspective metalinguistic presentation of Louisiana French dialects in the context of Standard French instruction. Rationale \& methods for the last alternative are outlined.

	abstract = {This mixed-method study examined French immersion teachers' attitudes toward French-related varieties of Louisiana (i.e., Cajun French and Louisiana Creole) and the extent these local varieties are integrated into their classrooms. Participants were employed as French immersion teachers during the 2008-2009 academic school year. In the past, Louisiana schools played a large role in the decline of Louisiana French and the fostering of negative attitudes toward these varieties. In fact, a slogan of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) is L'ecole a detruit le francais, l'ecole doit le restaurer (School destroyed French, school must restore it). Research was collected in three distinct phases. During the first quantitative phase, ninety-two teachers completed a subjective reaction Matched Guise test by listening to and evaluating five different varieties of French (Cajun French, Louisiana Creole, Quebecois French, Acadian French of New Brunswick, and International French). During the second quantitative phase, ninety-one participants completed a background, attitudes, and integration questionnaire. Finally during the qualitative phase, twelve participants completed one-on-one interviews. The main findings suggest that participants in general have neutral attitudes toward Louisiana French and are open to integration and the Louisianification of the immersion curriculum but lack the content knowledge in order to teach these varieties to create the desired balance of International French and Louisiana French. Furthermore, participants felt that more efforts need to be made to hire local French immersion teachers to create more of a balance with teachers hired from abroad (i.e foreign associate teachers). Eleven main problems concerning the immersion program as did suggestions on how to make the profession more manageable emerged from the qualitative data. This study concludes that Louisiana French language and culture are minimally present in the immersion classroom. However, further efforts need to be made by teachers, administrators, grass-root organizations, and local community members if the immersion schools can be considered true supporters of language maintenance.

It was to be a 5-year educational program to teach Standard French to primary school students. While originally intended as a bilingual program, this proved overly ambitious \& the program now focuses on French as a second language. To implement the program, it was necessary to import foreign teachers (from France, Quebec, \& Belgium), which generated opposition to the program \& led to a debate over the need for a French education program in the Louisiana context. Assessment of the program indicated that there was an increase in the number of French speakers both in the Acadian parishes \& even more in the rest of the state. In 1990, a CODOFIL survey showed 57\% of the respondents under age 19 spoke French. The language effort was supported by increased cultural production by Cajun musicians \& writers, \& there was also an increase in the popularity of Cajun music. Cajun authors played a role in the creation of a written norm for Louisiana Creole. It is suggested that most of the state's resources were geared to the educational effort. The rest of the resources were to improve the status of French by removing institutional obstacles \& promoting ethnic pride.

	abstract = {As one of the rare Francophone regions in North America, Louisiana has a unique culture and French dialect, spawning from Acadian immigrants who came to the Louisiana colony in the latter part of the 18th century. As the Cajun identity evolved, several strong influences have shaped and formed the Cajun French language; yet, it remains in danger due to damages from a 1921 law prohibiting the use of French in Louisiana and increased exposure to Anglo-American culture. However, many efforts to promote Cajun French have been employed since 1968 and the creation of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), especially regarding the implementation of French-language immersion programs. In order to obtain their goal of preserving the Cajun French dialect, CODOFIL first realized the need to reestablish a sense of linguistic and cultural pride in the Cajun community. By hosting the World Acadian Congress in 1999, Louisiana Cajuns were able to reinforce important ties with other French-speaking communities in Canada and worldwide, thereby establishing pride in their French heritage. This new cultural identity, coupled with the immense popularity of Cajun music in Louisiana offers another method of strengthening the precarious future of Cajun French by presenting a new way to attract younger generations to the dialect. This work will explore the status of the French language and music in Louisiana today, focusing on the ways in which a strong cultural element could provide important tools for protecting and promoting the unique Cajun French dialect.

	abstract = {This paper examines the role that cultural identity and grassroots activism and community development have played in the creation, maintenance and expansion of Louisiana French immersion education. Although linguists tend to portray the extinction of endangered minority languages as inevitable, research on the effects of minority language immersion education provides evidence that this portrayal is not an accurate one. In Louisiana, community concerns over the eminent death of Louisiana French and its associate culture have mobilised parents, educators and other advocates to establish French immersion programmes in public schools throughout southern Louisiana. Issues of regional and familial cultural identity have provided much of the impetus to expand these programmes in the region. As a result of the successful community-based efforts to create and extend immersion education in Louisiana, there is now a growing youth population proficient in Louisiana French, providing hope that the region's unique Francophone culture remains an enduring, active presence.},

A one-way analysis of variance computed for average scores for the groups on the variables of linguistic contacts, French competency, desire/interest, \& language behavior indicated that all groups showed decreasing contacts with French, \& there was strong transfer from French to English. Weak networked students indicated poor French competencies. Responses indicated that respondents (1) are less likely to speak French, (2) perceive English as the dominant language in the community, (3) are predominantly schooled in English, \& (4) will not likely to be able to transfer French to a following generation. 6 Tables, 74 References.

In the wake of the revival and in spite of continued shift, another trend is apparent -- the writing of Louisiana French. Whereas shift clearly represents a stage of language decline, the creation of a written code functions as a key ingredient for language maintenance.

Drawing on in-depth observations of black and white middle-class, working-class, and poor families, Unequal Childhoods explores this fact, offering a picture of childhood today. Here are the frenetic families managing their children's hectic schedules of "leisure" activities; and here are families with plenty of time but little economic security. Lareau shows how middle-class parents, whether black or white, engage in a process of "concerted cultivation" designed to draw out children's talents and skills, while working-class and poor families rely on "the accomplishment of natural growth," in which a child's development unfolds spontaneously—as long as basic comfort, food, and shelter are provided. Each of these approaches to childrearing brings its own benefits and its own drawbacks. In identifying and analyzing differences between the two, Lareau demonstrates the power, and limits, of social class in shaping the lives of America's children. The first edition of Unequal Childhoods was an instant classic, portraying in riveting detail the unexpected ways in which social class influences parenting in white and African American families. A decade later, Annette Lareau has revisited the same families and interviewed the original subjects to examine the impact of social class in the transition to adulthood.},

The fields of education, linguistics, cognitive science, psychology, discourse processing, and computer science have all made recent strides in developing new methods for predicting the difficulty of texts for various populations.

	abstract = {This article examines two well-known innovations in Canadian English
(CE)—(æ) Retraction and Lowering (e.g., mad,
pat) and (aw) Fronting (e.g., loud,
mouse)— with a view to discovering the routes by which
phonological change diffuses. The data are from St. John's,
Newfoundland, one of the few remaining Canadian communities where the
variety spoken by the founding population remains relatively intact.
Because this variety is leveling toward CE (Clarke,
1991), the St. John's context enables us to tap into processes
of dialect shift while they are taking place. This glimpse reveals the
developmental nature of linguistic constraints during the early stages of
change. Moreover, by focusing on preadolescent and adolescent speakers,
age groups that are often overlooked in favor of adult samples (Eckert, 1988:183), the analysis situates the locus of
change on the adolescent years. Taken together, these results provide an
important gauge for tracking the progress of phonological change.Special thanks to Jack Chambers, Sandra Clarke,

Our results provide a striking validation of the incrementation model, confirming its value as a key to understanding the evolution of linguistic systems. However, although our findings reveal the predicted peak in the apparent-time progress of a change and corroborate the female tendency to lead innovation, there is no absolute contrast between men and women with respect to incrementation. Instead, quantitative differences in the social embedding of linguistic change correlate with the rate of the change in the speech community.},

	abstract = {Neutral evolution assumes that there are no selective forces distinguishing different variants in a population. Despite this striking assumption, many recent studies have sought to assess whether neutrality can provide a good description of different episodes of cultural change. One approach has been to test whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny distributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given number of new instances within a specified time interval: a classic example is the distribution of baby names. Using an overlapping generations model we show that these distributions consist of two phases: a power law phase with a constant exponent of -3/2, followed by an exponential cut-off for variants with very large numbers of progeny. Maximum likelihood estimations of the model parameters provide a direct way to establish whether observed empirical patterns are consistent with neutral evolution. We apply our approach to a complete data set of baby names from Australia. Crucially we show that analyses based on only the most popular variants, as is often the case in studies of cultural evolution, can provide misleading evidence for underlying transmission hypotheses. While neutrality provides a plausible description of progeny distributions of abundant variants, rare variants deviate from neutrality. Further, we develop a simulation framework that allows for the detection of alternative cultural transmission processes. We show that anti-novelty bias is able to replicate the complete progeny distribution of the Australian data set.},

Are phonological variables transferred to writing on the level of graphemes, or is the larger system of contextual patterning also transferred? This paper considers orthographic coda deletions corresponding to the phonological variables of (ing) and (t,d). In both cases, orthography mirrors speech: reduction of the -ing suffix depends on the word's syntactic category, and reduction of the -t,-d suffix depends on the succeeding phonological context. These spellings are more frequently used in informal conversational contexts, and in areas with high proportions of African Americans, again mirroring the patterning of the associated phonological variables. This suggests a deep connection between variation in the two modalities, necessitating a new account of the production of cross-modal variation.},

The role of social networks in language variation has been studied using a wide range of metrics. This study critically examines the effect of different dimensions of networks on different aspects of language variation. Three dimensions of personal network (ethnicity, nationality, diversity) are evaluated in relation to three levels of language structure (phonetic form, accent range, language choice) over three generations of British Asians. The results indicate a scaling of network influences. The two metrics relating to qualities of an individual's ties are more historically and culturally specific, whereas the network metric that relates to the structure of an individual's social world appears to exert a more general effect on accent repertoires across generations. This two-tier typology—network qualities (more culturally contingent) and network structures (more general)—facilitates an integrated understanding of previous studies and a more structured methodology for studying the effect of social networks on language.},

Although it is claimed that /l/ is dark in all syllable positions in northern varieties of both languages, there have been no quantitative investigations of this feature which consider cross-linguistic phonetic differences, the differing nature of language contact between North East and North West Wales, and differences in the way both languages are acquired by speakers. The dataset of 32 Welsh-English bilinguals, aged 16–18, was stratified by speaker sex, home language, and area. Tokens of /l/ in word-initial onset and word-final coda positions were analysed acoustically. The results show cross-linguistic differences in onset position and that such differences were found to be greater in the speech of female speakers. Differences were also found between the two areas. These results are discussed with reference to the influence of extra-linguistic factors on speech production and the possible social meaning associated with dark /l/.},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives:The objectives of the present research were to examine the cognitive consequences of trilingualism and explain them relative to the cognitive consequences of bilingualism.Approach:A comparison of cognitive abilities in trilinguals and bilinguals was conducted. In addition, we proposed a cognitive plasticity framework to account for cognitive differences and similarities between trilinguals and bilinguals.Data and analysis:Three aspects of cognition were analyzed: (1) cognitive reserve in older adults, as measured by age of onset of Alzheimer?s disease and mild cognitive impairment; (2) inhibitory control in children and younger adults, as measured by response times on behavioral Simon and flanker tasks; and (3) memory generalization in infants and toddlers, as measured by accuracy on behavioral deferred imitation tasks. Results were considered within a framework of cognitive plasticity, which took into account several factors that may affect plasticity including the age of learning a third language and the extent to which additional cognitive resources are needed to learn the third language.Findings:A mixed pattern of results was observed. In some cases, such as cognitive reserve in older adults, trilinguals showed larger advantages than did bilinguals. On other measures, for example inhibitory control in children and younger adults, trilinguals were found to exhibit the same advantages as bilinguals. In still other cases, such as memory generalization in infants and toddlers, trilinguals did not demonstrate the advantages seen in bilinguals.Originality:This study is the first comprehensive analysis of how learning a third language affects the cognitive abilities that are modified by bilingual experience, and the first to propose a cognitive plasticity framework that can explain and predict trilingual-bilingual differences.Significance:This research shows that the cognitive consequences of trilingualism are not simply an extension of bilingualism?s effects; rather, trilingualism has distinct consequences, with theoretical implications for our understanding of linguistic and cognitive processes and their plasticity, as well as applied-science implications for using second and third language learning in educational and rehabilitative contexts to foster successful cognitive development and aging.},

Bd, 2, 125?154) Specificity Hypothesis ? ?Embedded language elements in code-switching have a high degree of semantic specificity? (p. 128).Approach:Adopting a concept-based approach to examine loanwords in a large, reliable corpus, the study pursues the following question: Do loanwords have a high degree of semantic specificity relative to their receiving-language equivalents? Specificity is operationalized as an entropy measure of the target word?s environment, the assumption being that more specific words have less variety in their surrounding context.Data and analysis:To test this hypothesis, Anglicisms in a 24-million-word newspaper corpus of Argentine Spanish were processed in three stages: detecting loanwords, selecting semantic equivalents, and measuring specificity.Findings/conclusions:A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test revealed that loanwords receive significantly lower entropy scores, that is, they are more specific than their Spanish equivalents. The results suggest a possible motive for adopting loanwords when terms already exist in the source language, namely, to utilize words that provide more nuanced meaning.Originality:Methodologically, this study offers innovative applications of computational methods to loanword research, employing a distributional model to measure entropy. Theoretically, it addresses an underrepresented aspect of loanword adoption, semantics, by extending Backus?s hypothesis to loanwords and increasing its scope to data often viewed as ?monolingual?.Significance/implications:The conclusions offer novel perspectives on loanwords with existing semantic equivalents, often viewed as ?unnecessary? when compared to loanwords that introduce new concepts into the recipient language (e.g. blog). With the notion of specificity, we may understand these loanwords as disruptors to the semantic system of the recipient language, dividing up the semantic space formerly occupied solely by the native equivalent, thus increasing the level of nuance expressed in the original concept.},

Network research in sociolinguistics suggests that integration in a local community network promotes speakers' retention of local linguistic variants in the context of pressure from external or standard dialects. In most sociolinguistic network research, a speaker is assigned a single score along an index representing the aggregate of several network and other social features. We propose that contemporary network methods in adjacent disciplines can profitably apply to sociolinguistics, thereby facilitating not only more generalizable quantitative analysis but also new questions about the relational nature of linguistic variables. Two network analysis methods—cohesive blocking and Quadratic Assignment Procedure regression—are used to evaluate the social network factors shaping the retreat from the Southern Vowel Shift (SVS) in Raleigh, North Carolina. The data come from a 160-speaker subset of a conversational corpus. Significant network effects indicate that network proximity to Raleigh's urban core promotes retention of SVS features, and that network similarity between speakers corresponds to linguistic similarity. Contemporary social-network methods can contribute to linguistic analysis by providing a holistic picture of the community's structure.

In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate.

This new model uses social networks as a basis for adopter categorization, instead of solely relying on the system-level analysis used previously. The present paper argues that these four adopter categories can be created either with respect to the entire social system, or with respect to an individual's personal network. This dual typology is used to analyze three diffusion datasets to show how external influence and opinion leadership channel the diffusion of innovations. Network thresholds can be used (1) to vary the definition of behavioral contagion, (2) to predict the pattern of diffusion of innovations, and (3) to identify opinion leaders and followers in order to understand the two-step flow hypothesis better.},

We analyze 50 dissertations and 50 grammars from a ten-year span (2003-2012) to assess the current state of the field. Publications are critiqued on the basis of transparency of data collection methods, analysis and storage, as well as citation of primary data. While we found examples of transparent reporting in these areas, much of the surveyed research does not include key information about methodology or data. We acknowledge that descriptive linguists often practice good methodology in data collection, but as a field we need to build a better culture with regard to making this clear in research writing. Thus we conclude with suggested benchmarks for the kind of information we believe is vital for creating a rich and useful research methodology in both long and short format descriptive research writing.},

	abstract = {People learn language from their social environment. As individuals differ in their social networks, they might be exposed to input with different lexical distributions, and these might influence their linguistic representations and lexical choices. In this article we test the relation between linguistic performance and 3 social network properties that should influence input variability, namely, network size, network heterogeneity, and network density. In particular, we examine how these social network properties influence lexical prediction, lexical access, and lexical use. To do so, in Study 1, participants predicted how people of different ages would name pictures, and in Study 2 participants named the pictures themselves. In both studies, we examined how participants’ social network properties related to their performance. In Study 3, we ran simulations on norms we collected to see how age variability in one’s network influences the distribution of different names in the input. In all studies, network age heterogeneity influenced performance leading to better prediction, faster response times for difficult-to-name items, and less entropy in input distribution. These results suggest that individual differences in social network properties can influence linguistic behavior. Specifically, they show that having a more heterogeneous network is associated with better performance. These results also show that the same factors influence lexical prediction and lexical production, suggesting the two might be related.},

While being highly efficient, Fluid Communities is able to find communities in synthetic graphs with an accuracy close to the current best alternatives. Additionally, Fluid Communities is the first propagation-based algorithm capable of identifying a variable number of communities in network. To illustrate the relevance of the algorithm, we evaluate the diversity of the communities found by Fluid Communities, and find them to be significantly different from the ones found by alternative methods.},

The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of “authorative” information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of “hub pages” that join them together in  the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristrics for link-based analysis.},

Consequently, network scientists have compared community detection algorithms on benchmark networks with a particular form of community structure and classified them based on the mathematical techniques they employ. However, this comparison can be misleading because apparent similarities in their mathematical machinery can disguise different reasons for why we would want to employ community detection in the first place. Here we provide a focused review of these different motivations that underpin community detection. This problem-driven classification is useful in applied network science, where it is important to select an appropriate algorithm for the given purpose. Moreover, highlighting the different approaches to community detection also delineates the many lines of research and points out open directions and avenues for future research.},

We investigate how both independent invention and the modification and refinement of established innovations impact on cultural dynamics and diversity. Further, we analyse these relationships in the presence of biases in cultural learning and find that the introduction of new variants typically increases cultural diversity substantially in the short term, but may decrease long-term diversity. Independent invention generally supports higher levels of cultural diversity than refinement. Repeated patterns of innovation through refinement generate characteristic oscillating trends in diversity, with increasing trends towards greater average diversity observed for medium but not low innovation rates. Conformity weakens the relationship between innovation and diversity. The level of cultural diversity, and pattern of temporal dynamics, potentially provide clues as to the underlying process, which can be used to interpret empirical data.},

I delineate how the application of signaling games helps to reproduce and depict mechanisms of semantic change. For that purpose I present a model that combines a signaling game with innovative reinforcement learning; in simulation runs I conduct this game repeatedly within a multi-agent setup, where agents are arranged in social network structures. The results of these runs are contrasted with an attested theory from sociolinguistics: the ‘weak tie’ theory. Analyses of the produced data target a deeper understanding of the role of environmental variables for the promotion of (1) semantic change or (2) solidity of semantic conventions.},

	abstract = {This thesis concerns Chiac, a dialect of Acadian French (AF) that emerged in a small speech community of AF-English bilingual teenagers in Moncton, Canada. Syntactically and morphologically, Chiac closely resembles AF, but it also makes use of a number of English lexical items and other English-influenced constructions. This thesis addresses two related questions with regard to Chiac: how (and why) did it emerge, and what is its structure?
I answer the first question in Chapters 2--3, arguing that Chiac emerged as a result of a confluence of social factors. Speakers' age, their bilingualism, their urban environment and their attitudes toward the languages spoken in Moncton resulted in speakers sharing a sense of identity and wanting to distinguish themselves from other social groups. Within the framework of Cognitive Grammar (CG) I model the emergence of Chiac due to these social factors. The advantage of a CG approach is that, in addition to allowing for a unified analysis of how social factors influence linguistic structure, it treats the bilingual linguistic system in the same way as the monolingual linguistic system in that no special modules or formal devices are needed to account for bilingual language usage.
Chapters 4--6 address the second question: what is the structure of Chiac? Still using the framework of CG I describe the Chiac lexicon, as well as some of its noun phrase and verb phrase constructions. I find, for example, that English-based lexical items in Chiac tend to involve certain semantic domains related to teen culture (drugs, social groups at school etc.). The motivation for this usage seems to be that speakers' adolescence is highly relevant to their sense of identity, and that mixing English with their parents' language (AF) is a way of asserting that identity.
This thesis therefore has both theoretical and descriptive relevance in that, in addition to describing specific constructions, I show how constructions and ultimately an entire system emerged as a result of language mixing that is motivated by social factors.},

However, there have been few studies of the phenomenon actually in progress. This article describes the development of a new variety in the English New Town of Milton Keynes, designated in 1967. The article is structured around eight "principles" that relate the process of koineization to its outcomes. Recordings were made of 48 Milton Keynes-born children in three age groups (4, 8, and 12), the principal caregiver of each child, and several elderly locally born residents. Quantitative analysis of ten phonetic variables suggests that substantial but not complete focusing occurs in the child generation. The lack of linguistic continuity in the New Town is demonstrated, and the time scale of koineization there is discussed. Finally, it is shown that demography and the social-network characteristics of individuals are crucial to the outcomes of koineization.},

	abstract = {This dissertation examines variation in mood choice and in the expression of future temporal reference in a conservative variety of Acadian French. The data come from two sociolinguistic corpora representative of the variety spoken in the Baie Sainte-Marie area of southwest Nova Scotia. Since varieties of Acadian French preserve features lost in most other contemporary varieties, they offer a unique opportunity to study linguistic systems closely related to earlier stages of the language.
The methodological and theoretical approaches involve both variationist sociolinguistics and generative theories of grammar, thus combining two areas of research not usually brought together. The study focuses on two linguistic variables: 1) use of the subjunctive vs. other moods (indicative and conditional), and 2) expression of future temporal reference (inflected future vs. periphrastic future). The analysis of the subjunctive shows that there is actually little variation and the subjunctive mood is well preserved. The variation which is observed can be accounted for by assuming that mood choice turns on the presence or absence of a semantic feature, assertion. The results for the future temporal reference variable show, contrary to what has been found for Laurentian varieties, that the inflected future remains in robust use, with the strongest predictor of variant choice being temporal reference, with proximate actions favouring the periphrastic future. The future results are in line with both prior studies of Acadian French and with grammarians' characterization of the latter variant as le futur proche. The results also differ from those of studies of Laurentian varieties in that sentential polarity plays no role in conditioning variant choice. The formal analysis accounts for variation by positing two loci of variation (one pre-syntax and one post-syntax) which accurately predicts the observed frequencies of the variants.
Overall, this dissertation shows that while there may be variable usage there is no evidence of change in the linguistic system for these two variables, thus supporting the characterization of this variety of Acadian French as conservative. The formal analyses contribute to an emerging line of research, sometimes referred to as sociosyntax, which aims at accounting for variation-within the grammar.},

Junior secondary school children (N unspecified, aged 12) were given access to their native language in their language arts program. A control group continued the usual program centered on ME. The groups were tested regularly in ME to determine the effects of reading in Creole. Results showed that reading Creole neither confused nor impaired the children's reading of Standard English. Although it was not possible to prove that reading Creole helped in reading English, the enjoyment \& enthusiasm displayed by the students in reading the Creole material implied that West Indian children should be allowed to read \& write Creole as part of their education. 2 Tables, 3 Figures, 17 References.

Contributions from the speech community to sociolinguistics include the development of variable rules and frameworks for the analysis of tense-aspect markers, social class, style, narratives, and speech events, plus research topics and employment for students and faculty. The contributions which sociolinguistics could make in return to the African American speech community -- but has not done sufficiently -- include the induction of African Americans into linguistics, the representation of African Americans in our writings, and involvement in courts, workplaces, and schools, especially with respect to the teaching of reading and the language arts. This last issue has surged to public attention following the Oakland School Board's "Ebonics" resolutions on Dec. 18, 1996. The present unequal partnership between researcher and researched is widespread within linguistics. Suggestions are made for establishing service in return as a general principle and practice of teaching and research in our field.},

The data show lexical variability at a finer scale than has usually been considered in American dialectology, and show variation that appears independent of both region and class in its patterning. The data indicate a need for further investigation into socio-linguistic processes in occupational settings.},

I present an overview of the literature on social meaning, discuss what grammars are models of, and argue that in order to model socially meaningful variation, competence grammars need to be extended to include social meaning, precompiled phrases, and probabilistic or frequentistic information. I then explore different heuristics for defining the boundaries of competence grammar and discuss the commonalities between the proposed additions and the kind of linguistic knowledge which is generally assumed to comprise competence grammar.},

As evidence for our approach, we contrast a variety of free and bound elements, showing that in every case, subparts of words are smaller than CP/DP and full words correspond to CP/DP.

The data are drawn from two historical corpora of English texts: The Early Modern section of HCET (Helsinki Corpus of English Texts, 1500-1700), and ARCHER (A Representative Corpus of Historical English Registers, 1650-1900). The case studies are situated within an integrated theoretical framework of change in derivational morphology which addresses neologising, productivity, variation, lexicalization and semantic change. Morphological productivity, a topic typically treated in synchronic morphology, is placed at the centre of this framework. The rationale for this approach is that the measurement of productivity provides a way to observe change in progress in derivational morphology. The chief task then, is to develop procedures for measuring productivity in historical corpora. The history of the suffixes will be investigated quantitatively by measuring their productivity across temporal periods and across test-type/register, and qualitatively by analysing derived nominalizations in discourse contexts to understand the effect of register and/or text type on nominalization. The result is a socio-historical account of derived nominalization, which demonstrates the ways in which neologising (and thus productivity) can be driven by contextual factors, discourse processes and stylistic considerations.},

We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis.},

	abstract = {The meanings of deverbal nouns have been classified by various linguists in terms of case, such as instrument or result of action. However, there is some debate as to whether meaning can attach to the derivational suffixes such as -ation, -ment, etc., which form these nouns. For some of the meanings of the suffixes themselves are unspecified, apart from the grammatical recategorisation involved in changing a verb to a noun. Others see an affix as interacting with the base to affect the semantics of the derivative. Earlier historical linguists described deverbal suffixes as attracting a 'nexus' of meanings which are common to all of them, and which cluster round a central semantic notion such as 'action/fact'. Furthermore, it has been suggested that each suffix develops through time a unique combination of such meanings in a hierarchy of its own. This is the question I am concerned with here. My interest is in the French nominal suffixes -ment, -ance/-ence, -ation, -age and -al, which entered Middle English (ME) via borrowings from French, and which now form abstract nouns in English by attaching themselves mainly to verbs. I shall argue that from their earliest appearance in English these suffixes began to select characteristically from the nexus of common meanings, in terms both of the kinds of bases to which each suffix was characteristically attached, and also of the kinds of contexts in which words formed in it tended to appear. I further conclude that each one may specialise in a distinct aspect of the central meaning 'action/fact', such as specific instance or quality. My method has been to examine the integration into English of each suffix, then to take samples of about 200 words in each, in order to determine the semantic categories in which they were used in their earliest recorded citations in the MED and OED. Some of these contexts will be analysed in detail.},

With established loanwords, however, they share the characteristics of morphological and syntactic integration into the host language and consist of single content words or compounds. Furthermore, both types of loanwords differ from intrasentential code-switching — alternate sentence fragments in the two languages, each of which is grammatical by monolingual standards from the standpoints of appropriate function words, morphology, and syntax. In a large corpus of Tamil—English bilingual speech, many words of English origin are found in objects governed by Tamil verbs and vice versa. The equivalence constraint on intrasentential code-switching predicts that no code-switch should occur between verb and object in an SOV/SVO bilingual situation, and hence that objects whose language differs from that of the verb must be borrowed, if only for the nonce. To verify this prediction, we compare quantitatively the distribution across various syntactic contexts of both native Tamil and English—origin complements of Tamil verbs, and find them to be parallel. But the strongest evidence in favor of the nonce borrowing hypothesis comes from an analysis of variable accusative and dative case marking in these complements, in which the English-origin material is shown, morphologically and syntactically, to be virtually indistinguishable from Tamil (nonpronominal) nouns. In addition, we present supporting evidence from the genitive, locative, and other cases and from nonce borrowings from Tamil into these speakers' English.},

	abstract = {Gurindji Kriol is a contact variety spoken in northern Australia which has been identified as a mixed language. Yet its status as an autonomous language system must be questioned for three reasons — (i) it continues to be spoken alongside its source languages, Gurindji and Kriol, (ii) it has a close diachronic and synchronic relationship to code-switching between Gurindji and Kriol, and (iii) its structure bears a strong resemblance to patterns found in this code-switching. Nonetheless in this paper I present criteria which support the claim of ‘language-hood’ for Gurindji Kriol. I demonstrate that Gurindji Kriol (i) is a stable language variety (it has child language learners and a high degree of inter-speaker consistency), (ii) has developed independent forms and structural subsystems which have not been adopted back into the source languages, and (iii) contains structural features from both languages which is rare in other language contact varieties including Kriol/Gurindji code-switching. I also present a number of structural indicators which can be used to distinguish Gurindji Kriol mixed language clauses from code-switched clauses.},

	abstract = {Social media is international: users from different cultures and language backgrounds are generating and sharing content. But language barriers emerge in the communication landscape online. In the quest for language diversity and universal access, the vision of a cosmopolitan Internet has stumbled over the language frontier.
Expatriates, minorities, diasporic communities, and language learners play an important role in forming transnational networks, creating social ties across borders. Many users of social media are multicultural and multilingual; they are mediating between language communities. In the microblogging site Twitter, information spreads across languages and countries. How are multilingual users of Twitter connecting language groups? What are the factors influencing their language choices? This research advances a step towards understanding the network structures and communication strategies that enable intercultural dialog, cross-language sharing of information, and awareness of global problems.
This dissertation research aims at: (1) exploring the ways in which multilingual users of Twitter are connecting different language groups in their social network; (2) modeling how the network influences their language choices; (3) and exploring what the textual features of their posts can elicit about language choices and mediation between groups.
This dissertation goes beyond survey information about multilingualism and provides a deeper understanding about the structural relations between language communities in Twitter. This research work is one of the few that apply social network analysis to the study of sociolinguistic questions on the Internet. Focusing on the social networks of multilingual users, this dissertation contributes an original classification of network types based on the patterns of connections between language groups. Also, it applies the novel idea of modeling the influence of network factors in the language choices of the user. Finally, this dissertation tests the hypothesis that the type of exchange influences language choice, and explores with a theme analysis how other textual features might elicit cross-cultural awareness. These results can inform the design of social media platforms.},

	abstract = {My approach to the study of language is based on the assumption that knowledge of language can be properly characterized by means of a generative grammar, i.e. a system of rules and principles that assigns structural descriptions to linguistic expressions. On this view, the basic concepts are those of 'grammar' and 'knowledge of grammar'. The concepts of 'language' and 'knowledge of language' are derivative: they involve a higher level of abstraction from psychological mechanisms and raise additional (though not necessarily important) problems. Of central concern, from this point of view, will be to determine the biological endowment that makes it possible for a grammar of the required sort to develop in human beings provided that they are exposed to some appropriate body of experience. This biological endowment may be regarded as a function that maps a body of experience into a particular grammar. The function itself is commonly referred to as universal grammar (u.g.) and can be expressed, in part, as a system of principles that determine the class of accessible particular grammars and their properties. Recent work suggests that u.g. consists, on the one hand, of a theory of so-called core grammar and, on the other, of a theory of permissible extensions and modifications of core grammar. Given the intricate internal structure of u.g., it can account for the superficially highly diverse grammars and languages that do in fact exist. Thus, what appear to be quite different systems of knowledge may arise from relatively little experience. A number of subsystems of u.g. have now been explored, each with its distinctive properties and possibilities of variation. Some current proposals concerning these systems are sketched, and some consequences considered with regard to the nature and acquisition of cognitive systems (including systems of knowledge) more generally.},

However, evidence from several linguistic changes (most importantly the rise of the periphrastic auxiliary do in late Middle English) shows that the general assumption is false. Instead, at least for syntactic cases, change seems to proceed at the same rate in all contexts. Contexts change together because they are merely surface manifestations of a single underlying change in grammar.

New language learning results follow directly; we can explicitly calculate how many positive examples on average (“sample complexity”) it will take for a learner to correctly identify a target language with high probability. We show how sample complexity varies with input distributions and learning regimes. In particular we find that the average time to converge under reasonable language input distributions for a simple three-parameter system first described by Gibson and Wexler (1994) is psychologically plausible, in the range of 100–150 positive examples. We further find that a simple random step algorithm - that is, simply jumping from one language hypothesis to another rather than changing one parameter at a time - works faster and always converges to the right target language, in contrast to the single-step, local parameter setting method advocated in some recent work.},

	url = {http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/8590/},
	abstract = {En langue des signes québécoise (LSQ), des différences linguistiques entre les productions de femmes et hommes sourds, ayant été scolarisés par des institutions religieuses distinctes avant 1960, ont été révélées (Dubuisson et Grimard, 2006). Ces variations peuvent être liées à l'exposition de ces sourds à des méthodes éducatives différentes sur le plan des langues des signes utilisées pour l'enseignement (Langue des signes française (LSF) pour les hommes, American sign language (ASL) pour les femmes (Veillette et al., 2005)) ainsi qu'au différent degré d'exposition au français oral également utilisé pour l'enseignement (Perreault, 2006) distinguant le groupe oralisant du groupe signant. Les travaux effectués jusqu'à maintenant sur les différences linguistiques des aînés portent principalement sur le lexique et aucune information n'est disponible sur la syntaxe ou sur d'autres composantes de la langue pouvant avoir été influencées par l'une ou l'autre de ces langues en contact. Sachant que des études descriptives sur chacune des langues révèlent des différences structurelles quant à l'ordre syntaxique (SVO pour l'ASL (Fischer, 1975) et le français (Sorés et Marchello-Nizia, 2005); SOV pour la LSF (Yau, 1993); SOV et OSV pour la LSQ (Bouchard et al., 1995)) et que la présence d'oralisation est fortement liée au degré d'exposition à la langue orale environnante (Plaza-Pust et Morales-López, 2008), la question de recherche de ce mémoire est : des différences grammaticales existent-elles entre le discours LSQ des sourds de groupes de femmes oralisantes, d'hommes oralisants et d'hommes signants? Les objectifs de recherche sont i) de décrire des productions LSQ de ces femmes et hommes sourds et ii) d'analyser deux cas de variation potentielle (ordre syntaxique et oralisation) dans leur production. Pour répondre à cette question, nous analysons un corpus de discours spontané en LSQ issu de 22 aînés sourds âgés de 60 ans et plus. Les résultats de cette recherche montrent que ce contexte de contact linguistique a un impact sur la fréquence de l'oralisation ainsi que sur l'ordre syntaxique dans le discours actuel des signeurs. Les femmes oralisantes montrent une influence du français et de l'ASL avec un fort taux d'oralisations et de propositions avec objet en position finale en opposition aux hommes signants oralisant moins et suivant davantage l'ordre avec verbe en finale. Les hommes oralisants produisent moins d'oralisation que les femmes, mais davantage de propositions avec objet en finale comparativement aux hommes signants. Ce mémoire ouvre donc la porte aux recherches futures en ce qu'il permet de mieux comprendre l'impact des choix didactiques sur la normalisation linguistique, ainsi que l'apport des autres langues sur la structure actuelle de la LSQ.},

We looked at communities of users on the Twitter website, and tested two established social-psychology theories that are usually performed at local scale. We found evidence of Communication Accommodation Theory, where community members vary their language characteristics depending on which community they are communicating with. We also found the level of linguistic variation correlated with how isolated a community was: evidence that there is Convergence between linked members. This demonstrates the power of methods which analyse subtle human behaviour on social networks.},

Although the nonstandard form has been labeled in the literature as a calque of Spanish tener que + infinitive 'to have to', it appears in Twitter messages in all of the dialects analyzed. In fact, in our sample there are dialects in which tenir que occurs more frequently than haver de. Grammatical person of the verb used (haver or tenir) is also analyzed as a factor behind the choice of modal periphrasis. Multivariate analysis has been employed, determining that both of these factors (dialect and grammatical person) are statistically significant. The results of the multivariate analysis allow us to apply van Coetsem's (1988) theoretical framework in an attempt to describe the language contact situation in the different dialects. Source-language (sl) agentivity appears to be at work in the dialects where the nonstandard variant is prevalent, while recipient-language (rl) agentivity could be behind the use of the standard variant in the other dialects.},

Innumerable articles in the popular press suggest that increasing use of IM by teens is leading to a breakdown in the English language. The analyses presented here are based on a unique corpus involving 72 teenagers and over a million words of natural, unmonitored IM. In addition, a corpus of speech from the same teenagers is examined tot comparison. Targeting well-known IM features and four areas of grammar, we show that IM is firmly rooted in the model of the extant language. It reflects the same structured heterogeneity (variation) and the same dynamic, ongoing processes of linguistic change that are currently under way in contemporary varieties of English. At the same time, IM is a unique new hybrid register exhibiting a fusion of the full range of variants from the speech community--formal, informal, and highly vernacular.},

Here we look more closely at the type of grammatical knowledge involved in intrasentential CS, by examining a widely attested structure in CS, bilingual compound verbs (BCVs). We consider the properties of compound verbs in general, including in monolingual contexts, their significance in the CS literature, notably for the notion of Matrix Language, and their implications for an understanding of bilingual grammars, broadly defined. We conclude that this widespread feature of bilingual speech is more than a convenient frame for inserting foreign words, and should be seen as part of a more general verb-formation process. The types of linguistic knowledge which allow such formations to emerge are based on what Sebba (1998) has called conceptual work, rather than on the simple interaction of two linguistic systems as such. We list a number of factors to be taken into account in trying to identify a CS grammar, within which idiolect, metalinguistic knowledge and community norms are particularly significant.},

The size of a mixed English constituent in K-Pop lyrics varies from a single word to an entire song. The manifestation of linguistic sophistication differs from Koreanized English only intelligible to the Korean public to American English with African American Vernacular English (AAVE) features. Functions of English mixing are also varied from a simple attention-getter for stylistic purposes to assertion of liberated self and exercising freedom of speech. K-Pop is a sociolinguistic breathing space for young South Koreans to construct identity and socially connect with others. The findings of the study show that K-Pop provides discursive space for South Korean youth to assert their self-identity, to create new meanings, to challenge dominant representations of authority, to resist mainstream norms and values, and to reject older generations’ conservatism. English is used as discourse of resistance. Young South Korean artists are empowered by tactical English switches into Korean. Appropriations between global and local dialogues yield resultant linguistic hybrids. Mixing two language codes epitomizes South Korean youth's battle with their unsettling identities in dealing with the tension between global and local dialogues to which they are simultaneously exposed.},

Australian Hip Hop, though, appears to be phonologically defying the conventions of lyrical performance which have been held, to a greater or lesser extent, since rock ‘n’ roll's emergence in Australia. This paper examines this interesting sociolinguistic phenomenon by providing a picture of phonological variation within youth music in Australia, enabling a comparison between Hip Hop and other genres. It argues that performance accent is closely tied to several factors, including cultural identity and genre appropriateness. In the case of Hip Hop, a local identity is maintained linguistically, in keeping with Hip Hop's philosophy of keepin’ it real, suggesting that the genre is simultaneously loyal to and distinct from its American origins.},

By aligning Nigerians' cultural and political experiences with those of African Americans and Jamaicans-whose languages have also been stigmatized as 'broken English'-these artists engage a Black Atlantic cultural tradition while simultaneously indexing a distinctly Nigerian public within that imagined transnational space. The formation of this public is complicated, however, by (among other things) the fact that Hausa-speaking Muslims from northern Nigeria are less likely than other Nigerians to use and affiliate with NP.

The discussion is based on illustrations drawn from a variety of sources, ranging from Western pop to North African rai music. The strategies identified include using translation to either replace or reduplicate the source material, rewriting with varying degrees of divergence from the original, juxtaposing components from different languages, and composing directly in a code switching variety. It is argued that in such lyrics translation and code switching often serve to produce very similar effects. Both may be used as affirmations of identity, as in-group markers, as stylistic devices, as a means of opening up the lyrics to outsiders or of producing effects such as alienation and exclusion. The effects achieved in particular cases are related to such variables as the identity of the performer/persona, the background of the audience and the specific content and theme of the song.

Attractive to some and disturbing to others are the attitude and flair of Kriolu rappers. A group of mostly young men of Cape Verdean descent, these rappers insist on speaking and singing in Kriolu, a creole language that lacks official-language status in both Portugal and Cape Verde. In this article, based on analyses of rap lyrics, excerpts from my fieldwork conversations with rappers, and structural features of the Kriolu language itself, I propose that Kriolu rap is a renewed interrogation of diaspora and of place-based identity. More generally, I propose that, when contextualized in terms of cultural history and (post)colonial politics, Kriolu rap offers insight into the relationship between words and music as part of a process of combining aesthetics with social claims.

	abstract = {While the global ethnic revival, starting in the late 1960s, resulted in minorities' movements to maintain their ethnic identity closely connected with the revitalization of minority languages, the other ethnic identity pattern in relation to language can be identified from the perspective of a rarely discussed minority group-the Buryats. This article has found that within the Buryat minority group the assimilation strategy, widespread during the Soviet period, has been replaced by the integration strategy and a combination of strategies. In the latter case, linguistic integration is combined with the economic assimilation and marital separation. Two options have been identified regarding the language and identity link among Buryats. First, the native language is considered a salient feature of the Buryat ethnic identity, and it is actually used and maintained. However, more powerful is the trend to abandon the language as an irrelevant ethnocultural identity marker. In general, the native language has for Buryats a rather symbolic, unifying value and its abandoning does not affect the ethnic identity itself. Finally, the article explores external and internal determining factors, which have formed this identity pattern. As external factors we consider the ethnic and language policy of the Soviet Union, modernization, the Russian-dominated majority-minority configuration, and insufficient institutional support of the Buryat language restoration and development. The internal factor is the widespread attitude among the Buryats themselves consisting of a negative evaluation of the Buryat language and unwillingness to learn it and to transfer it to the next generations. The Buryat case shows that ethnic identity, in fact, can survive the loss of the indigenous group language, which has been sacrificed to the historical pressures of the last two centuries. It was the only possible ethnic identity pattern not only for the Buryat ethnic group, but also for many other minorities in Russia.},

	abstract = {Abstract A growing body of literature has explored issues surrounding the maintenance and development of a minority heritage language among immigrants and their children in relation to their ethnic identities in multi-ethnic societies. However, most of the studies either have alluded to heritage learners' language competence by way of their attitudes and ideologies toward their heritage and language maintenance or have addressed their competence by way of self-assessment measures alone. This study examines the interrelationship between Korean heritage learners' perceived and actual competence in Korean vis-à-vis their ethnic identity orientation. Thirty second-generation Korean-American participants completed questionnaires on their language background, ethnic identity orientation, and self-assessment of their speaking and writing skills in Korean. Their speech and writing samples in Korean were elicited with picture stimuli. Results suggest that there was a strong correlation among the subjective and objective assessment of the heritage learners' Korean language skills and their Korean ethnic identity. It was also suggested that the heritage learners who have a strong Korean identity tend to have better competence in Korean, meaning that the strong Korean identity serves as a self-enhancing bias in their self-assessment of the Korean language.},

	abstract = {Language planning in the domain of the courts in Cyprus is of interest because of the concealed salience placed upon the link between language and either state or ethnic identity. The article first examines the dominant role of English in court from 1960 until 1988 as reflecting Cyprocentric state identity associations. It then investigates the establishment of the use of Greek after the enactment of Law N.67/1988 brought the reversal of the linguistic situation. The law, which aimed at putting into action the provisions on language of the 1960 Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus and at safeguarding the use and protection of Greek, derived from Hellenocentric tendencies and its ultimate purpose was to foster Greek ethnic identity rather than to enhance the identity of the state of Cyprus. The above observations are illustrated in the analysis of the legislation on language in the courts, the linguistic situation in the judicial proceedings, and the court verdicts/judgments pertaining to language use. Finally, the article draws parallels between Fishman's `nationism' and `nationalism' and the Greek-Cypriots' language selections and identity orientations.},

They demonstrated the construct validity of a 3-dimensional measure \& examined potential biases introduced by alternative methods such as constant sum scale. Their findings support the distinction between the 3 subdimensions of language use (English use in family, in media consumption, \& while shopping). The authors found evidence of discriminant validity. By using 3 approaches to construct validity, they found that the support for discriminant validity strengthens the discriminant \& convergent properties of the instrument. Findings concerning method effects were less obvious. If the traditional multitrait-multimethod approach indicates no method effects, more stringent approaches (e.g., analysis of variance \& correlated uniqueness approach) indicate the presence of limited method effects. The authors provide implications regarding measurement of ethnic identity. Adapted from the source document},

Spanish language is central to resisting such phenotype-racial categorization, which denies Dominican Americans their Hispanic ethnicity. Through discourse analysis of naturally occurring peer interaction at a high school, this article shows how a Dominican American who is phenotypically indistinguishable from African Americans uses language, in both intra- and inter-ethnic contexts, to negotiate identity and resist ascription to totalizing phenotype-racial categories. In using language to resist such hegemonic social categorization, the Dominican second generation is contributing to the transformation of existing social categories and the constitution of new ones in the US.},

Genealogy is also an important and highly prized means of identification. In this article the saying of Te Whānau Moana group of extended families (hapū) of Karikari in the far northern region of the country is explained as an example. Given that such sayings are always expressed in Māori, the question arises as to how children whose parents and teachers are not good speakers of Māori will fare in terms of identity. Difficulties in the Māori language of teachers and children in Māori-language immersion preschools and schools (kōhanga reo and kura kaupapa Māori) are identified as grammar-related. Solutions are suggested whereby the grammar of second-language learners can be improved.},

Nevertheless, these languages were important to these children, especially for maintaining the bond with their families and communities. Consequently, these languages were crucial for maintaining the children's sense of identity as being both British and Pakistani. The children thus experienced multiple identities to which their languages contributed, and which, on the whole, they accepted with equanimity.},

I did a one-year ethnographic study of the Korean language classes (basic and intermediate levels) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, which were largely populated by second- and 1.5-generation Korean Americans. From these Korean-American college students, who have 'successfully' negotiated through the American educational system, I learned that becoming an English speaker does not necessarily mean the loss of ethnic identity, and that learning Korean (a 'heritage' language) does not necessarily lead to homogeneous ethnic identity formation. Although the classroom is certainly a place in which language knowledge is imparted, much classroom activity utilises words and grammatical points as semantic mediators of culture, history, and even politics; in short, the stakes are high. My ethnography focuses on the micro-practices of language teaching and learning in order to explore these interactions, and thereby take up identity formation and transformation. Participants' personal language repertoire and use reflect diverse social worlds and locations (including time of immigration, place of residence, and relationship to the homeland) through which their transnational lived histories have been constituted.},

Through a largely qualitative analysis, a longitudinal picture is sketched of the way certain styles of singing have shifted over time. Wherever possible, these linguistic changes are charted against the broader cultural, cross-cultural \& sociopolitical changes which parallel them \& which, arguably, have helped shape them. 37 References.

	abstract = {The dissertation research explores the survivability of Louisiana French and St Lucian French Creole (Kweyol). Most sociolinguistic research on minority languages has focused on language death and has ignored global process. However, the continued and renewed salience of ethnicity as a social organizer gives reason to expect that the death of many minority languages may be arrested or reversed. The Louisiana and St Lucia cases are significant in that Louisiana French and Kweyol have both been the object of organized efforts at revaluation since the 1960s. The cases are also significant from a comparative, global perspective because of their integration into broader pan-cultural movements and the different positions they occupy within the world-system. This study investigates in relation to each case: (1) the global processes that are associated with ethnic revival, (2) the nature of ethnic revival and (3) the association between the ethnic revival movements, on the one hand, and patterns of language use and language attitudes, on the other.
The project uses a comparative approach to identify common themes and to isolate phenomena unique to each case. Data from secondary sources inform global process, the ethnic movements and the sociohistorical narratives of each case. Interviews with randomly selected residents and the protagonists of linguistic preservation and promotion in Louisiana and St Lucia furnish data on ethnic revival and on the sociolinguistic status of Louisiana French and Kweyol. The findings support the thesis that Louisiana French and Kweyol ethnic revival is associated with changes in the hegemonic status and the integration of the world-system. However, ethnic revival in Louisiana and St Lucia has only partially arrested the decline in the use and viability of Louisiana French and Kweyol. English remains the predominant language of social discourse in all public domains of language use, although Louisiana French and Kweyol have made some gains. Moreover, despite the revival movements, English continues to usurp social space from the ethnic languages in private domains of use as well. The greatest effect of ethnic revival on the survivability of Louisiana French and Kweyol lies in the positive changes of people's attitudes toward the languages.},

This paper will focus on word-initial metathesis, a widespread phenomenon of Cajun French. Word-initial metathesis occurs either after a consonant cluster (e.g. grenier-gernier ‘attic’) or after a single /r/ (eg. retourner-ertourner ‘to return’), in which case the conditioning environment is larger than the phonological word. I will show that the two phenomena are two aspects of the same process. I will first consider two non- linear approaches to metathesis and show that they are both unable to explicitly point out the triggering force of the sonorant /r/. I will present a prosodic analysis where the initial syllable is degenerate in that it lacks a vocalic nucleus. Epenthesis of a vocalic segment will save the deficient syllable. Surface differences between the two types of metatheses will be attributed to weight distinctions within the French syllable. It will be claimed that epenthesis, a powerful device which should be highly constrained, is well motivated in the present context because the segments involved form a natural phonetic class.},

The first experiment tested for differences between concepts associated with country and hip-hop music. The second experiment examined the ability of the same music genres to influence person perception in regard to those same concepts. Significant differences were found not only in concepts typically used to define the genres, such as ethnicity, rural—urban classification and age, but also in other concepts that play an important role in communication research and persuasion, such as trustworthiness, friendliness and political ideology.},

It includes various tasks, such as music classification, clustering, perception and cognition, etc. In this article, we report our recent perceptual studies on segmentation and genre classification, two indispensable steps in the MIR process. Segmentation attempts to capture ‘drastic’ changes in music and provides a basis for further perceptual and computational analysis while genre classification amounts to separating music into different groups such that each group uniformly represents a music genre. Our perceptual study considers various related issues. The goal of this work is to (1) explore and deepen our understanding of the relationship between perceptual surface and perceptual structure of music through segmentation by human subjects and (2)reveal and demonstrate the multi-label nature of genre classification.},

	abstract = {Abstract In music genre classification, most approaches rely on statistical characteristics of low-level features computed on short audio frames. In these methods, it is implicitly considered that frames carry equally relevant information loads and that either individual frames, or distributions thereof, somehow capture the specificities of each genre. In this paper we study the representation space defined by short-term audio features with respect to class boundaries, and compare different processing techniques to partition this space. These partitions are evaluated in terms of accuracy on two genre classification tasks, with several types of classifiers. Experiments show that a randomized and unsupervised partition of the space, used in conjunction with a Markov Model classifier lead to accuracies comparable to the state of the art. We also show that unsupervised partitions of the space tend to create less hubs.},

This harmonic priming effect occurs for fine syntactic-like changes in context and is observed irrespective of the extent of participants' musical expertise (Bigand \&amp; Pineau, Perception and Psychophysics, 59 (1997) 1098). The present study investigates how the harmonic context influences the processing of phonemes in vocal music. Eight-chord sequences were presented to participants. The four notes of each chord were played with synthetic phonemes and participants were required to quickly decide whether the last chord (the target) was sung on a syllable containing the phoneme /i/ or /u/. The musical relationship of the target chord to the previous context was manipulated so that the target chord acted as a referential tonic chord or as a congruent but less structurally important subdominant chord. Phoneme monitoring was faster for the tonic chord than for the subdominant chord. This finding has several implications for music cognition and speech perception. It also suggests that musical and phonemic processing interact at some stage of processing.},

Samples of the speech of eight speakers (three from Aukštaitija (northeast Lithuania) and five from Dzūkija (southern Lithuania)) and six singers (three from each of the regions) were analyzed. The methods of acoustical analysis (Praat-aided) and statistical analysis were applied. The analyzed parameters include time values of the consonants, their SPLs, F1 and F2 of their vocalized parts, and their pitch excursions from the preceding vowels. The collation of the results of consonant measurements led to the following inference: a distinct enunciation in the spoken dialect correlates with the vocalization of consonants in the singing: the difference in the values in speech transforms into the difference in the values of musical parameters, in exaggerated form. Dzūkai show higher values of the vocalization, in comparison with Aukštaičiai. Hence, some traits of the singing dialect are neither 'purely musical' nor 'purely vocal', but rather speech-dependent. The results raise some practical implications concerning the ethnomusicological studies and practical singing in the contemporary folk groups. (English)},

In most usages the term "language" is superordinate to "dialect," but the nature of this relationship may be either linguistic or social, the latter problem falling in the province of sociolinguistics. It is shown how the development of a vernacular, popularly called a dialect, into a language is intimately related to the development of writing and the growth of nationalism. This process is shown to involve the selection, codification, acceptance, and elaboration of a linguistic norm.},

Under the standard assumption that the subject remains relatively low in these languages compared to Germanic languages, this category fails to be a diagnostic, since both verb movement operations cross the subject. The analysis presented here starts from the theory of verb movement developed in Koeneman (2000), which argues that the verb does not move to prefabricated functional head positions but moves in order to project one or more of its functional features (tense and agreement). It is shown how this theory offers a better understanding of verb movement (parameters) than mainstream approaches. After developing a concrete proposal for verb movement variation in Germanic, the paper tries to extend this analysis to the Celtic languages, so that a uniform analysis of verb movement (variation) ensues. The main conclusion is that it is very unlikely that Celtic languages have a verb movement operation involving an agreement projection. They are better analyzed as having a verb movement operation that projects tense features. The result is that the nature of verb movement in Germanic and Celtic is basically the same.},

For sentences with an aspectual marker, I discuss the temporal semantics of le and guo in detail, showing how their tense/aspectual meanings contribute to temporal reference. I propose to analyze le as an event realization operator and guo as an anteriority operator. For subordinate clauses, I show that temporal reference of complement clauses of verbs is basically determined by verbal semantics of individual verbs, which may impose some temporal restriction on the temporal location of the embedded event. As for relative clauses and temporal adverbial clauses, many different factors such as lexical verbal semantics, referential properties of determiners, lifetime effect of noun phrases, semantic or pragmatics constraints on temporal connectives, inference rules and world knowledge, etc., all interact to help determine temporal reference. Many data discussed in this paper indicate that there is no evidence of (covert) tenses in Chinese. Therefore, challenging work remains for those who have claimed that Tense Phrase is projected in Chinese phrase structures.},

In Balkan clauses, the phrase headed by the complementizer takes a phrase headed by an invariant modal particle as complement. The Tense/Agreement complex, the auxiliaries, and the main verb follow MP. In addition, Balkan languages share interesting varieties of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}{\textbackslash}text\{-movement\}\$ for non-finite verbs, with theoretical consequences for principles of UG. In Bulgarian and Rumanian, (Long) Head-movement raises \$\{{\textbackslash}rm V\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ to C0 across the finite \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Aux\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$, as in Pročel sǔm knigata 'I have read the book'; such structures comply with the Empty Category Principle via Relativized Minimality, and escape the Head Movement Constraint. In Albanian, Greek, and Rumanian, Head-movement places the imperative \$\{{\textbackslash}rm V\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ in C0, as in Ghrápse to 'Write it!'. Albanian imperatives show Long Head Movement and comply with the ECP like other LHM patterns in cases where the V-stem precedes the clitic and the affix in that order: Tregoj-i-ni 'Tell him!'.

I begin by decomposing tenses syntactically into a temporal ordering predicate (the true tense, on this approach) and two time-denoting arguments corresponding to covert a reference time (RT) argument and an eventuality time (ET) argument containing the verb phrase. Control theory accounts for the denotation of the RT argument, deriving the distinction between main clause and subordinate clause tenses. The theory of covert movement is used to account for the independent/indexical interpretation of relative clause tenses, and for the correlation between independent tense interpretation and a de re construal of the relative clause. A theory of “past polarity”, based on traditional negative polarity theory, accounts both for the simultaneous “sequence of tense” construal of past tenses in subordinate clauses embedded within past tense contexts, and for the obligatory indexical/independent interpretation of present tense in a relative clause embedded within a past tense context. Combined with the copy theory of movement, the polarity theory also provides an account of the semantics of double access sentences, treating them as involving a special kind of reconstruction effect.},

	abstract = {The paper investigates a number of asymmetries in the behavior of subjects in Germanic, Celtic/Arabic, Romance, and Greek. The languages under investigation divide into two main groups with respect to a cluster of properties, including the availability of pro-drop with referential subjects, the possibility of VSO/VOS orders, the A/A′ status of subjects in SVO orders, the presence/absence of Definiteness Restriction (DR)-effects in unaccusative constructions, the existence of verb-raising independently of V-2, and others. We argue that the key factor in this split is a parametrization in the way the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) is checked: move/merge XP vs. move/merge \$\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$. The first option is taken in Germanic, the second in Celtic, Greek, and Romance. According to our proposal, the EPP relates to checking of a nominal feature of AGR (cf. Chomsky 1995), and move/merge \$\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ languages satisfy the EPP via V-raising, as their verbal agreement morphology includes the requisite nominal feature (cf. Taraldsen 1978). Moreover, we demonstrate that the further differences that exist between Celtic/Arabic on the one hand and Romance/Greek on the other are related to the parametric availability of Spec, TP for subjects (cf. Jonas and Bobaljik 1993, Bobaljik and Jonas 1996). In Celtic and Arabic, Spec, TP for subjects is licensed, resulting in VSO orders with VP external subjects. In Greek and Romance, Spec, TP is not licensed, resulting in 'subject inverted' orders with VP internal subjects. In other words, we show that within the class of move/merge \$\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ languages, a further partition emerges which is due to the same parameter dividing Germanic languages into two major classes. We demonstrate that combining the proposed EPP/AGR parameter with the Spec, TP parameter gives four language-types with distinct properties.},

First, feature-valuation under closest c-command permits a unified treatment of Bantu operator agreement and West Germanic complementizer agreement with subjects. Second, it explains a common requirement that subjects be in situ in Bantu A′-movement constructions: a subject raised to Spec, TP would intervene between C's φ-features and the operator in outer Spec, vP that must value them. Like wh-movement, subject raising always coincides with agreement in Bantu; I propose that Bantu uninterpretable φ-features have EPP features. These are distinct from the classical EPP of T which, I argue, underlies a verbal agreement requirement giving every Bantu inflectional category a specifier.

	abstract = {In this paper I explore the elements that make up the German distributive universal quantifier jeder, and the structural relationships among them. I argue that jeder consists of three overt morphemes je-d-er, which are heads in an extended adjectival projection (xAP). Their relative order is derived by movement [xAPje d er tjeP]. Je corresponds to the adjectival stem, -d- is an adjectival article (which in turn is analyzed as a relative complementizer) and -er is an agreement head, AgrA. The xAP further contains movement traces/ copies of the nominal which jeder quantifies over. One of these copies is in the complement of je where, I claim, it supplies the restriction (distributive key or range). The components of the proposal are all motivated independently of jeder: (i) the morphology of jeder identifies it as adjectival, hence an analysis of it must incorporate an (independently motivated) adjectival syntax; (ii) a comparison with the distributive dual quantifier beid- ‘both’ further informs the syntactic analysis internal to the word jeder; and (iii) a comparison of je in jeder and in other je-words suggests that je takes an N(P) complement, a fact that confirms the expectations regarding the selectional properties of je raised by the preceding discussion. Finally, a comparison of jeder with counterparts of it in other languages, as well as with other complex determiners in German, will broaden the scope and corroborate important aspects of the present proposal.},

	abstract = {This article proposes that plural marking on nouns in Persian is licensed only if those nouns are contained within D/QPs. This proposal accounts for why plural-marked nouns are construed as definite unless an overt marker of indefiniteness appears, and why plural marking does not cooccur with numerals unless the noun phrase is definite. It is also shown that the indefinite marker in Persian is quantitative rather than cardinal and is thus associated with higher functional structure within the noun phrase than in English. In English, on the other hand, number marking, the indefinite article, and the grammatical distinction between count and mass nouns, are all realized at the level of NumP. Differences in the interpretation of bare noun phrases in English and Persian are therefore explained by the claim that argument noun phrases must minimally be NumPs in English while Persian lacks this projection altogether.},

British English do has some characteristics of a fully deleted phrase, and some of a pro-form. The paper proposes that deletion is involved in this construction, but of a smaller constituent than can host wh-movement or long quantifier-raising. Therefore, deletion must occur within the syntax, in order to bleed syntactic processes. It is further shown that, within a phase-based syntax, Voice must be a phase rather than v, but that both functional heads must exist, and offers a new explanation for the incompatibility of passive and British English do, as well as an account of why some languages, like English, lack impersonal passives, while others, such as Dutch, allow them.},

The assumption of two nominal functional categories permits a structural account of differences in the distribution of elements that function as first/second person pronouns and those that function as third person pronouns. It is hypothesized that 1st/2nd person pronouns are DPs which contain only the head D and that this head is specified for person, number and gender. In contrast, 3rd person pronouns have a more complex structure, where D is specified for person and Num is specified for number and gender. Similarities between past tense agreement and 1st/2nd person pronouns on the one hand and between present tense agreement and 3rd person pronouns on the other suggest that the same nominal functional categories that act as pronouns also act as agreement. In other words, the difference between pronouns and agreement lies not in their category, but in their role in the syntax. Finally, this view of pronouns and agreement is applied to complex null subject phenomena in Modern Hebrew. In order to account for the fact that the distribution of null subjects varies across persons and across tenses, we propose a matching condition on both the category and content of the null pronoun and agreement.},

(a) Spell-out rules for pronouns may target nonterminal categories. (b) Pro drop is zero spell-out (i.e., deletion) of regular pronouns. (c) Competition between spell-out rules is governed by the Elsewhere Principle. A full derivation relies on an acquisitional strategy motivated by the absence of negative evidence.

	abstract = {Serbo-Croatian (SC) is a language without articles, probably the only category of speech that has uncontroversially and crosslinguistically been argued to occupy the head of the Determiner Phrase (DP). This paper argues that even SC, a language without articles, projects a DP on top of NPs in argument positions. The strongest evidence comes from noun/pronoun asymmetries, where the pronouns precede, and nouns follow, certain intensifying adjectives. Assuming that these adjectives occupy a fixed syntactic position, the conclusion must be that pronouns occupy a structurally higher position than nouns. Since the evidence of such asymmetries is extremely sparse in the data, the children presumably cannot rely on them to conclude that there is a DP in SC. Since there are also no articles in SC, children have virtually no evidence of the existence of a DP. It must be then that the projection of DPs is a universal property, independent of the presence of the lexical item which solely occupies the head of the projection. Morphological properties of SC pronouns and adjectives actually support the existence of more than just one functional projection in the noun phrase in SC. The paper derives Greenberg's universal 43, which states that pronouns are more likely to have (gender) morphology than nouns, by arguing that pronouns move (overtly) through more functional projections than nouns, and ultimately land in D.},

Instead, local binding has three compositional sources. Morphological economy (Burzio 1989) construes an object pronoun reflexively just if no morphologically reflexive expression has the same agreement features. This elsewhere-type principle, generally satisfied in Haitian, applies only exceptionally in French and English, creating surface anaphor/pronoun complementarity as the predominant pattern in those languages (Bouchard 1984). Referential economy (Pica 1987) "anaphorizes" a possessive DP headed by an inalienably possessed noun such as tèt 'head' or kò 'body'. Inherent reflexivity licenses a null internal argument with an inalienably possessed lexical constant BODY. The necessity of all three mechanisms in Haitian argues for the reduction of the LGB binding conditions (Chomsky 1981) to the "On Binding" framework (Chomsky 1980).},

In previous investigations breathing kinematics, subglottal pressures, and voice source characteristics of a group of premier country singers have been analyzed. The present study complements the description of these singers' voice properties by examining the formant frequencies in five of these country singers' spoken and sung versions of the national anthem and of a song of their own choosing. The formant frequencies were measured for identical phonemes under both conditions. Comparisons revealed that the singers used the same or slightly higher formant frequencies when they were singing than when they were speaking. The differences may be related to the higher fundamental frequency in singing. These findings are in good agreement with previous observations regarding breathing, subglottal pressures, and voice source, but are in marked contrast to what has been found for classically trained singers.},

It explores the ways in which hip-hop mediates the adoption of African American English-influenced speech by these young people and how this phenomenon complicates traditional sociolinguistic conceptions of identity. There is a discourse within hip-hop that privileges the urban black street experience. This forces white middle-class hip-hoppers whose race and class origins distance them from this socially located space to construct themselves linguistically as authentic via both form and content.},

It focuses on media representations of Chiac, a traditionally low-status variety of Acadian French. We consider performances of this variety in the adventures of an animated superhero, Acadieman, presented in a cable TV show running on Rogers TV from 2005 to 2009. We first contextualize Acadieman in terms of the linguistic and cultural contexts in which Chiac is spoken. We then consider how particular social meanings are created through contrasts between Chiac-speaking characters and speakers of other varieties. While the juxtaposition of varieties is at one level quite humorous, on another level it draws on complex indexicalities and valorizes the local variety and, by extension, its speakers. Finally, we argue that the Acadieman phenomenon provides a discursive space within which present-day Acadian identities can be negotiated. (English)},

To compare the structure of two varieties of French (Acadian French and Laurentian French), I adapt the comparative sociolinguistics approach to compare the syntactic structure of these varieties. Specifically, I focus on the effects of a single linguistic constraint across multiple sociolinguistic variables. I argue that such a comparison provides insights into the underlying grammatical structures of the varieties under comparison, differences that may have remained hidden otherwise. To illustrate the approach, I focus on a single constraint, sentential polarity, and I analyze its effects on two sociolinguistic variables, yes/no questions and future temporal reference. Results show that the polarity constraint is operative in Laurentian French for both variables, but inoperative in Acadian French. To account for this difference, I argue that Laurentian French negative structures involve a negative head above the tense phrase while Acadian French does not.},

In Experiments 1 and 2, Dutch–English bilinguals code-switched in describing pictures while being cued with word orders that are either shared or not shared between Dutch and English. In Experiments 3 and 4, the same task was embedded in a confederate-scripted dialogue situation, and the confederate’s use of word order and sentence position of switching was manipulated. We found that participants had a clear preference for using the shared word order when they switched languages, but also aligned their word order choices and code-switching patterns with the confederate. These findings demonstrate how the integration of languages in sentence production depends on processes of syntactic co-activation between languages and on processes of alignment between dialogue partners, and extend the notion of interactive alignment to bilingual speech and code-switching.},

Experimental evidence is provided that this substantially increases the range of networks for which centrality analysis is feasible. The betweenness centrality index is essential in the analysis of social networks, but costly to compute.

This article summarizes previous work incorporating network theory in questions of language change and discusses a practice noticeably absent from classical sociolinguistics: the simulation of language change. In  simulation experiments, sociolinguistic theories of language change – especially those employing social network structure – can be tested in a virtual society free from the hindrance of data sparseness.

possible links between African American Vernacular English
(aave) and Atlantic Creoles, a connection that has served as
the foundation of the Creolist Hypothesis in the on-going debate over
the origins of aave. One variety that has been of particular
interest in this debate is Gullah, which has been hypothetically linked
to aave since some of the earliest statements of the Creolist
Hypothesis. To date, however, very little research has been done on
copula variability in Gullah itself. This study, therefore, provides an
analysis of copula variability in present affirmative contexts in
Gullah. Variation is found among full, contracted, and zero forms in
1st person singular, plural/2nd person singular, and 3rd person
singular environments. The analysis also reveals some parallels between
Gullah and aave that offer support for the theory of an
aave/creole connection.I

The speech behaviors of these respondents with respect to variants of six linguistic variables (each with a black English [BE] and a colloquial Standard English variant) are quantified and the statistical relationships between the VCI scores and linguistic behavior are determined. The results of the study reveal that respondents in the older age groups (40-59, 60+) are more likely to choose BE variants than respondents in the younger age groups (18-25, 26-39), and that there are consistent statistically significant correlations between high scores on the VCI and the choice of BE variants of the linguistic variables. This is taken to support the proposal that the Social Network Theory approach, of which the VCI concept is a part, is capable of explaining intracommunity linguistic variation in socioeconomically homogeneous areas such as the black community studied.},

In the first case, findings provide insight into social change experienced by generations of villagers marked by the Spanish Civil War and the Franco regime. In the second, data provide evidence that, in this small and relatively homogeneous community, sex and political orientation are factors that influence the use of an established sociolinguistic variable. Speech data used in the study were obtained in a series of recorded interviews conducted by the author.

Drawing on data from such diverse contexts as advertising, tourism, historical texts, naturally occurring conversation, classroom interaction and interviews, leading authors in the field of sociolinguistics in this volume explore how linguistic stancetaking is implicated in the representation of self, personal style and acts of stylization, and self- and other-positioning. The analyses also focus on how speakers deploy and take up stances vis-a-vis sociolinguistic variables and the critical role of stance in the processes of indexicalization: how linguistic forms come to be associated with social categories and meanings. In doing so, many of the authors address critical issues of power and social reproduction, examining how stance is implicated in the production, reproduction and potential change of social and linguistic hierarchies and ideologies. This volume maps out the terrain of existing sociolinguistic and linguistic anthropological research on stance, synthesizes how it relates to existing theoretical orientations, and identifies a framework for future research.},

This study maps the geographic patterns of 30+ common nonstandard spellings on Twitter (e.g., sholl ‘sure’). It shows that nonstandard AAVE orthography delineates distinct dialect regions with shared phonological and lexical features. These regions are not coterminous with traditional North American dialect regions; rather, they align with patterns of movement during the Great Migrations.},

	url = {http://search.proquest.com/docview/304976615/},
	abstract = {This dissertation examines the adaptation of loanwords in natural speech based on loanword data from sociolinguistic interviews with native French speakers in Montréal. The Francophone sample was supplemented with interviews with native Spanish-speaking Montrealers, to examine the influence of bilinguals, often reported to be the introducers of borrowings. The social and linguistic factors favoring adaptation as opposed to importation of foreign segments are considered, and within the category of adaptation, the extent to which this adaptation is phonetic vs. phonological is explored. Acoustic analysis of the vowels reveals that the patterns observed lend support to both phonetic and phonological approaches. Some surprising patterns are discovered, notably the adaptation of English /æ/, which exhibits prenasal tensing. Phonetic and social explanations for this result are proposed. For consonants, the adaptation patterns of /r/ and /h/ are found to be conditioned by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, individual speakers' linguistic ability. Throughout the analysis, limited evidence is found for the influence of neighborhood bilingualism, with individual bilingualism being the predominant determining factor for segment importation in the loanword data, in addition to earliest attestation date, frequency, and sometimes additional social factors. The predominance of individual bilingualism over community bilingualism is explained by the social composition of Montréal, as well as the distribution of the present sample in terms of social characteristics. Finally, in the analysis of the Hispanophone sample, it is found that while bilinguals influence the variants' rate of use, they do not affect the grammatical constraints applying to each of the variants, suggesting a solution to the question of the particular role of bilinguals. This study elucidates many of the complex and multifaceted issues related to loanword adaptation, serving as a contribution to several fields of linguistics, including sociolinguistics, phonology, phonetics, and the study of language contact. This dissertation also contributes to the growing body of knowledge about the linguistic behavior of the multilingual speech community of Montréal.},

In order to understand these questions of identity and belonging, and to scientifically control the interpretation of the linguistic behavior of Cajun speakers, a general survey has been conducted on the linguistic attitudes and cultural identity of a sample of 929 individuals stratified by age and sex from four communities. Our results show that Cajun identity rests fundamentally in the linguistic ability of the speakers, regardless of the age group one Is In: the more one has access to the Cajun language, the more one self-identifies as Cajun. In general, respondents claim that the necessary criteria to be considered Cajun are just those criteria that they themselves satisfy We will demonstrate that there appear to be several 'paths' to take insofar as the Cajun community identity in Louisiana is concerned. However, this segmentation obviously has not been established or maintained without creating considerable tension between members of the cultural Cajun community.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web- and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

	abstract = {Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing.

We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85\%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet.

To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the state-of-the-art in overlapping community detection algorithms, quality measures, and benchmarks. A thorough comparison of different algorithms (a total of fourteen) is provided. In addition to community-level evaluation, we propose a framework for evaluating algorithm' ability to detect overlapping nodes, which helps to assess overdetection and underdetection. After considering community-level detection performance measured by normalized mutual information, the Omega index, and node-level detection performance measured by F-score, we reached the following conclusions. For low overlapping density networks, SLPA, OSLOM, Game, and COPRA offer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with high overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both SLPA and Game provide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that the detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved. A common feature observed by various algorithms in real-world networks is the relatively small fraction of overlapping nodes (typically less than 30\%), each of which belongs to only 2 or 3 communities.},

	abstract = {Detecting clusters or communities in large real-world graphs such as large social or information networks is a problem of considerable interest. In practice, one typically chooses an objective function that captures the intuition of a network cluster as set of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity, and then one applies approximation algorithms or heuristics to extract sets of nodes that are related to the objective function and that "look like" good communities for the application of interest. In this paper, we explore a range of network community detection methods in order to compare them and to understand their relative performance and the systematic biases in the clusters they identify. We evaluate several common objective functions that are used to formalize the notion of a network community, and we examine several different classes of approximation algorithms that aim to optimize such objective functions. In addition, rather than simply fixing an objective and asking for an approximation to the best cluster of any size, we consider a size-resolved version of the optimization problem. Considering community quality as a function of its size provides a much finer lens with which to examine community detection algorithms, since objective functions and approximation algorithms often have non-obvious size-dependent behavior., Related Persons: Rappa, Michael ; Jones, Paul ; Freire, Juliana ; Chakrabarti, Soumen},

	abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

Many popular community-finding algorithms partition the entire graph into non-overlapping communities. We show that on a wide range of empirical networks, from different domains, significant numbers of cliques are split across separate partitions, as produced by such algorithms. We examine the largest connected component of the sub graph formed by retaining only edges in cliques, and apply partitioning strategies that explicitly minimise the number of cliques split. We conclude that, due to the connectedness of many networks, any community finding algorithm that produces partitions must fail to find at least some significant structures. Moreover, contrary to traditional intuition, in some empirical networks, strong ties and cliques frequently do cross community boundaries.},

	abstract = {As a social media, online social networks play a vital role in the social information diffusion. However, due to its unique complexity, the mechanism of the diffusion in online social networks is different from the ones in other types of networks and remains unclear to us. Meanwhile, few works have been done to reveal the coupled dynamics of both the structure and the diffusion of online social networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a model to investigate how the structure is coupled with the diffusion in online social networks from the view of weak ties. Through numerical experiments on large-scale online social networks, we find that in contrast to some previous research results, selecting weak ties preferentially to republish cannot make the information diffuse quickly, while random selection can achieve this goal. However, when we remove the weak ties gradually, the coverage of the information will drop sharply even in the case of random selection. We also give a reasonable explanation for this by extra analysis and experiments. Finally, we conclude that weak ties play a subtle role in the information diffusion in online social networks. On one hand, they act as bridges to connect isolated local communities together and break through the local trapping of the information. On the other hand, selecting them as preferential paths to republish cannot help the information spread further in the network. As a result, weak ties might be of use in the control of the virus spread and the private information diffusion in real-world applications.},

Here we examine the communication patterns of millions of mobile phone users, allowing us to simultaneously study the local and the global structure of a society-wide communication network. We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

The underlying assumption is that attendance at mutual events gives an implicit social network between people. We take an axiomatic approach to this problem. Starting from a list of axioms, which a measure of tie strength must satisfy, we characterize functions that satisfy all the axioms. We then show that there is a range of tie-strength measures that satisfy this characterization. A measure of tie strength induces a ranking on the edges of the social network (and on the set of neighbors for every person). We show that for applications where the ranking, and not the absolute value of the tie strength, is the important thing about the measure, the axioms are equivalent to a natural partial order. To settle on a particular measure, we must make a non-obvious decision about extending this partial order to a total order. This decision is best left to particular applications. We also classify existing tie-strength measures according to the axioms that they satisfy; and observe that none of the "self-referential" tie-strength measures satisfy the axioms. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach; show the completeness and soundness of our axioms, and present Kendall Tau Rank Correlation between various tie-strength measures.},

We investigated whether several fundamental processes of relationship formation were evident at this age, including reciprocity, popularity, and triadic closure effects. We expected these mechanisms to change in importance over time as the network crystallizes, allowing more complex structures to evolve from simpler ones in a process we refer to as structural cascading. We analyzed intensive longitudinal observational data of children’s interactions using the SIENA actor-based model. We found evidence that reciprocity, popularity, and triadic closure all shaped the formation of preschool children’s networks. The influence of reciprocity remained consistent, whereas popularity and triadic closure became increasingly important over the course of the school year. Interactions between age and endogenous network effects were nonsignificant, suggesting that these network formation processes were not moderated by age in this sample of young children. We discuss the implications of our longitudinal network approach and findings for the study of early network developmental processes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08359},
	abstract = {Evolution and propagation of the world's languages is a complex phenomenon, driven, to a large extent, by social interactions. Multilingual society can be seen as a system of interacting agents, where the interaction leads to a modification of the language spoken by the individuals. Two people can reach the state of full linguistic compatibility due to the positive interactions, like transfer of loanwords. But, on the other hand, if they speak entirely different languages, they will separate from each other. These simple observations make the network science the most suitable framework to describe and analyze dynamics of language change. Although many mechanisms have been explained, we lack a qualitative description of the scaling behavior for different sizes of a population. Here we address the issue of the language diversity in societies of different sizes, and we show that local interactions are crucial to capture characteristics of the empirical data. We propose a model of social interactions, extending the idea from, that explains the growth of the language diversity with the size of a population of country or society. We argue that high clustering and network disintegration are the most important characteristics of models properly describing empirical data. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.},

L'isolement des métayers francophones fut renforcé par une idéologie égalitaire. De ce milieu, la musique cadjine émergea comme l'un des indices de la société louisianaise francophone. Le déclin de la culture du coton entraîna des perturbations dans l'équilibre démographique entre le milieu agricole et le village, favorisant ainsi réclusion d'une classe marchande issue des rangs des agriculteurs. Au moyen d'une réinterprétation de la culture rurale en milieu urbain, cette nouvelle bourgeoisie chercha à garantir la survivance culturelle. Utilisant la radio, les journaux, et se servant de l'appui externe des « puristes » du folklore, ils exploitèrent d'une manière sélective les traits ethniques. Bien que promu sur la place publique, le français continua à se dévaloriser en milieu privé ou familial.L'impact de cette transformation diffère selon les groupes. Les métayers à la retraite de Mamou, les plus authentiquement cadjins par leur attachement quotidien aux valeurs sociales et linguistiques traditionnelles, sont les moins susceptibles de promouvoir la survivance et la transmission de cette culture.},

The social psychological concept of affective meaning in language is measured in a single, bilingual culture and applied to the study of bilingualism, language shift, and the transmission of culture through language.  The data are collected from three generations of people identifying as Cajun in South Louisiana and a small comparative sample of elderly, non-Cajuns in the Southwest.  Quantitative, affective data - collected from all study participants - are bolstered by qualitative video- and audio-based data collected using anthropology-based field techniques from Cajun French/English bilingual participants, oral family histories collected from middle-aged participants, and survey data collected from high school student participants.  These data and personal accounts of lives, histories, and language conception and change provide the basis for answering the following research questions: 1) When using their different languages, do bilingual speakers hold different meanings for words that have the same translated meanings? 2) Can language shift be tracked affectively? 3) Does loss of language mean loss of culture?  The answer to each of these questions is yes.  It is my hope that the methods developed in this study will provide the basis for future language recording and analysis and cultural preservation projects.},

Language loss studies tend to emphasize demographic and economic factors over other social issues. This study about Cajun French, a fast-eroding French dialect still spoken by around 250,000 people in Louisiana, argues that language loss is a social as well as a discursive process and that academic knowledge and discourse both play a significant role in language politics. The study advocates the use of local knowledge to enhance our understanding of sociolinguistic issues involving unequal power relationships.},

Most codeswitching studies do indeed have a social aspect, because they typically use naturally occurring performance data as their base. This book, however, is just as much a study in grammatical theory as a study of language in use. The specific research question addressed is this: when speakers alternate between two or more linguistic varieties, how free is this alternation from the structural point of view? Carol Myers-Scotton develops a model of the morphosyntactic constraints on codeswitching and concludes that the principles governing codeswitching are the same everywhere.},

They model a particularistic approach to linguistic and ideological change that is sensitive not only to ideas about language that circulate in the media but also to the life experiences of particular speakers; and they show how an understanding of linguistic variation, language attitudes, and the stylized performance of dialect is enhanced by exploring the historical and ideological processes that make resources for these practices available.},

Audience design also accounts for bilingual or bidialectal code choices. Nonaudience factors like topic and setting derive their effect by association with addressee types. These style shifts are mainly responsive -- caused by a situational change. Speakers can also use style as initiative, to redefine the existing situation. Initiative style is primarily referee design: divergence from the addressee and towards an absent reference group. Referee design is especially prevalent in mass communication.},

The theoretical construct introduced in this paper enables researchers to avoid this contradiction. ‘Ethnolinguistic repertoire’ is defined as a fluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities. This construct shifts the analytic focus from ethnic ‘language varieties’ to individuals, ethnic groups, and their distinctive linguistic features. It addresses problems of inter-group, inter-speaker, and intra-speaker variation, as well as debates about who should be considered a speaker of a dialect. This approach, which can also be applied to social groupings beyond ethnicity, is discussed in relation to other approaches and is supported with data on language use in African American, Latino, and Jewish communities in the United States.},

First, we study the transformations occuring in songs from the traditional repertoire, through various audio renderings of the same songs. Second, we look at the way new songs, created in the traditional frame, address the lyrical content through old and contemporary themes, including the use of French language and bilingualism. This discussion is informed by interviews conducted with targeted musicians concerning their linguistic perceptions and respective artistic approaches. Thus, we eventually discover how, in addition to being a dance genre, Cajun and Creole music plays an essential role in the continued existence of French language in Louisiana.},

These include monolingual communities where speakers have a common base in linguistic structure as well as complex multilingual communities with internal social divisions. Illustrations are drawn from the author’s research in French Canada and Papua New Guinea, and from Blanc’s (1964) study of Baghdad. Finally, the study of multilingual speech communities is linked to the understanding of how superposed linguistic knowledge is integrated across the lifespans of individual speakers and across communal groups. Even in such situations, members who do not share a language seek to communicate with each other, finding ways of doing so that respond to social opportunities and circumvent social barriers.},

However, less is known about the social role of variation in online writing. This article examines online writing variation in the context of audience design, focusing on affordances offered by Twitter that allow users to modulate a message's intended audience. We find that the frequency of nonstandard lexical variables is inversely related to the size of the intended audience: as writers target smaller audiences, the frequency of lexical variables increases. In addition, these variables are more often used in messages that are addressed to individuals who are known to be geographically local. This phenomenon holds not only for geographically differentiated lexical variables, but also for nonstandard variables that are widely used throughout the United States. These findings suggest that users of social media are attuned to both the nature of their audience and the social meaning of lexical variation and that they customize their self-presentation accordingly.},

change across the lifespan: the apparent time construct, the adolescent peak, and
two different patterns of individual change. The apparent time construct is
attributed to a decline in flexibility toward language change over one’s lifetime;
this explanation is borne out in our model. The adolescent peak has been explained
by social networks: children interact more with caregivers a generation older until
later childhood and adolescence. We find that the peak also occurs with many
other network structures, so the peak is not specifically due to caregiver
interaction. The two patterns of individual change are one in which most
individuals change gradually, following the mean of community change, and
another in which most individuals have more categorical behavior and change
rapidly if they change at all. Our model suggests that they represent different
balances between the differential weighting of competing variants and degree of
accommodation to other speakers.},

to other heritage communities, with a corresponding lack of phonological
integration. We categorize the consultants as ‘coordinate bilinguals,’ who have
simultaneous on-line access to lexical items from both language-specific lexicons.
Consultants’ balanced bilingualism minimizes the cross-linguistic transfer
of both lexical items and phonology while accessing lexical items from either
lexicon. This coordinate bilingualism account is supported by the sociolinguistic
evidence of a context-dependent diglossia – parallel to the Dutch-Frisian
diglossia in the Netherlands – in which both English and West Frisian were
restricted to specific domains. It is argued here that social context, as well as the
multiple-lexicon coordinate bilingualism model, can best account for these data.},

Different languages can be a barrier between monolingual communities, and the dynamics of language choice could explain the prosperity or demise of local languages in an international setting. We study this interplay of language and network structure in diverse, multi-lingual societies, using Twitter. In our analysis, we are particularly interested in the role of bilinguals. Concretely, we attempt to quantify the degree to which users are the "bridge-builders" between monolingual language groups, while monolingual users cluster together. Also, with the revalidation of English as a lingua franca on Twitter, we reveal users of the native non-English language have higher influence than English users, and the language convergence pattern is consistent across the regions. Furthermore, we explore for which topics these users prefer their native language rather than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest sociolinguistic study in a network setting.},

	abstract = {Studies on code-switching over the past two decades have a propensity to focus on its spoken context, few on its written production. This study contributes to the under-studied area by investigating the occurrences of code-switching in electronic writing. The goal of this study is to examine the code-switching functions performed by five Malay-English bilingual users in their Facebook interactions. The data of this study were collected within one year from status updates posted by the bilingua l users on their Facebook wall. They were then coded, analysed and categorised according to the functions they served in the Facebook context. The classification of the code-switching functions was based on Gumperz's (1982) conversational code- switching and supplemented by Zentella (1997), San (2009) and Montes-Alcalá’s (2007). Findings indicate that code- switching occurs in online interaction to serve quotation, addressee specification, reiteration, message qualification, clarification, emphasis, checking, indicating emotions, availability, principle of economy and free switching functions. This study hopes to provide insights on the code-switching phenomenon in asynchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC). Additionally, the findings of this study will be of value for the development of code-switching studies in the CMC area.},

	abstract = {We present a study of the relationship between gender, linguistic style, and social networks, using a novel corpus of 14,000 Twitter users. Prior quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy population-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks that include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.},

	abstract = {Sociolinguistic variables have social evaluations and are used at different rates by different speakers. Variants become indexical of social traits and social identities, and are taken as defining ‘sociolects’ associated with identifiable groups: e.g., ‘working class speech’, ‘African-American English’. But since every speech community has many sociolinguistic variables, do the multiple variables cohere in forming sociolects? Thus if each variable has a variant considered ‘working class’, do working class speakers use all such variants simultaneously? Lectal coherence would imply that variables are correlated; if they are not, the cognitive and social reality of the ‘sociolect’ is problematic. This paper investigates intercorrelations among two phonological and two syntactic sociolinguistic variables in 20 speakers of Brazilian Portuguese. The results show considerable cross-variable correlation, but much of it may be explained by structural or grammatical coherence. There is some evidence of socially-motivated coherence, involving gender as well as status differentiation. Female speakers show stronger correlation among variables than males, while non-standard phonology seems to be indexical of male identity. The conclusion is that some sociolectal cohesion does exist, but it may be weaker and more multidimensional, than is commonly assumed. Future work on lects should problematize their coherence.},

they originate as code-switches and are gradually integrated into recipient-language
grammar; and (3) the processes underlying code-switching and borrowing are the
same. Results do not support the assumptions. Few other-language items persist,
let alone increase. Linguistic integration is abrupt, not gradual. Speakers
consistently distinguish lone other-language items from multiword fragments on
each of five linguistic diagnostics tested. They borrow the former, and code-switch
the latter. Code-switches are not converted into borrowings; instead the decision to
code-switch or borrow is made at the moment the other-language item is accessed.
We explore the implications of these findings for understanding the processes by
which other-language incorporations achieve the status of native items and their
consequences for theories of code-switching and borrowing.},

The first wave of variation studies established broad correlations between linguistic variables and the macrosociological categories of socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity, and age. The second wave employed ethnographic methods to explore the local categories and configurations that inhabit, or constitute, these broader categories. In both waves, variation was seen as marking social categories. This article sets out a theoretical foundation for the third wave, arguing that (a) variation constitutes a robust social semiotic system, potentially expressing the full range of social concerns in a given community; (b) the meanings of variables are underspecified, gaining more specific meanings in the context of styles, and (c) variation does not simply reflect, but also constructs, social meaning and hence is a force in social change.},

In Part I, analysis of one Punjabi-derived phonetic trait, examined in interview data only, suggests that younger women shift to exclusive use of the British prestige variant. Part II expands the analysis to four variables and to broader speech repertoires for four individuals. The repertoire analysis shows the conclusions in Part I to be inaccurate, and instead reveals: (1) retention of Punjabi traits by young women in the home domain; (2) two types of repertoire - flexible and fused; (3) a gendered reversal in repertoire type over time; and (4) a network diversity basis for these differences. Unlike the initial variationist analysis, the use of repertoire analysis and a new Network Diversity Index leads to the discovery of a shift among lower-middle-class British Asians from traditional Punjabi to urban British social structures.},

This discussion shows, notably, how systemic and extra-systemic factors play a role in the emergence of these innovations. We also demonstrate that there are interesting differences in the extent to which these innovations are used across speaker groups and communities, and we argue that such differences suggest that there are thresholds of language contact associated with the emergence, or lack thereof, of particular transfer-induced innovations.},

	abstract = {Communities of practice has emerged as an alternative to other current sociolinguistic models such as speech communities and social networks, particularly in the area of language and gender. The valorization of non-linguistic behaviours as adding further explanatory power to sociolinguistic models is timely: it has often been implicit in linguistic study (through ethnography) but rarely been given recognition. However, the types of self-constituting communities of interest to sociolinguists are not the same as the communities of learning studied by Lave and Wenger (1991) and Wenger (1998). If this construct is to be useful to sociolinguists, then the mechanisms by which it models access, gate-keeping and its internal hierarchy need development. Using Eckert's (2000) Belten High data, and other work on adolescent talk, it is argued that gaining legitimate peripheral participation is a matter of sanction from within the hierarchy. Individuals do not have open access to communities based solely on their desire to be part of that community and to take part in its practices. While practices may define the community, the community determines who has access to that practice.},

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using one of a number of possible "betweenness" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

Interviews (either formal or informal), and tape-recorded group sessions, are the methods most used currently. In research on a specific variable, the historical present tense (HP), none of these methods proved neutral or adequate. Although the historical present tense is very widely used in conversational narratives, its occurrence within interviews is so infrequent as to be striking. An explanation was found in the way in which the interview has a specific known place as a speech event in the culture of those whose speech was being studied. The so-called spontaneous interview does not have such a place, and for that very reason is even less satisfactory a source of data. The notion of natural speech is taken as properly equivalent to that of appropriate speech; as not equivalent to unselfconscious speech; and as observable easily, and often best, by simple techniques of participation.},

It is common in the study of variation to interpret variables as reflections of speakers' membership in social categories. Others have argued more recently that variables are associated not with the categories themselves, but with stances and characteristics that constitute those categories. The paper reviews some variation studies that show that variables do not have static meanings, but rather general meanings that become more specific in the context of styles. Building on Michael Silverstein's notion of indexical order, I argue that the meanings of variables are not precise or fixed but rather constitute a field of potential meanings – an indexical field, or constellation of ideologically related meanings, any one of which can be activated in the situated use of the variable. The field is fluid, and each new activation has the potential to change the field by building on ideological connections. Thus variation constitutes an indexical system that embeds ideology in language and that is in turn part and parcel of the construction of ideology.},

Indexical order is central to analyzing how semiotic agents access macro-sociological plane categories and concepts as values in the indexable realm of the micro-contextual. Through such access their relational identities are presupposed and creatively (trans)formed in interaction. We work through several classic examples of indexicality well-known in the literature of sociolinguistics, the clarification of which can be enhanced by using the concept of indexical order, viz., ‘T/V’ deference-indexicality, speech levels, indexically significant variation in phonetics informed by a standard phonological register. We conclude with an analysis of identity-commoditizing indexical overlays such as the American English register here dubbed “oinoglossia,” ‘wine talk’.},

Drawing on the sociolinguistic framework of audience design, the sociolinguistics of multilingualism and computer-mediated discourse analysis, the analysis examines language choice in initiating and responding contributions, metapragmatic negotiations of language style and the role of English as a resource among networked writers.},

The interrogatives qui and quoi are both still widely attested in Louisiana French, though in different locales. We explore Byers’ (1988) hypothesis that their distribution can be attributed to settlement patterns of Acadians (quoi) and 18th-century Creoles (qui). The J’AVONS pattern, though totally unattested today, is found in a dozen late 19th- and early 20th-century sources. Strikingly, though, most of these Louisiana attestations are not 1pl. but 1sg.We argue that this can be understood as a reanalysis of J’AVONS, precipitated by contact with non-J’AVONS dialects, prior to elimination of the form altogether, and contributing to the largely leveled verb paradigm one finds in Louisiana French today.},

Code-mixing is a form of linguistic behaviour which produces utterances consisting of elements taken from the lexicons of different languages. Some examples are given in (1).},

Central to the volume is the claim that stancetaking encompasses five general principles: it involves physical, attitudinal and/or moral positioning; it is a public action; it is inherently dialogic, interactional, and sequential; it indexes broader sociocultural contexts; and it is consequential to the interactants. Each paper explores one or more of these dimensions of stance from perspectives including interactional linguistics and conversation analysis, corpus linguistics, language description, discourse analysis, and sociocultural linguistics. Research languages include conversational American English, colloquial Indonesian, and Finnish. The understanding of stance that emerges is heterogeneous and variegated, and always intertwined with the pragmatic and social aspects of human conduct.},

	abstract = {In the course of the twentieth century, English has come to replace French—specifically, the variety known as Cajun French or Louisiana Regional French—as the primary language of communication in South Louisiana. In this language shift process, Cajun French has continued its steady decline in spite of French educational programs—including French immersion—established since the creation of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) in 1968 as well as a Cajun cultural revival. Today's high school students—who are generally monolingual in English but may have contact with Cajun French in family or community contexts and contact with International (i.e., Standard) French in educational settings—will be influential in determining the fate of Cajun French in Louisiana. This study presents survey data from 586 high school students in 13 schools in five parishes (i.e., counties) in Acadiana, Louisiana's French Triangle, to examine the extent of young people's contact with French as well as their attitudes toward Cajun French and International French. The quantitative analysis focuses on responses to opinion items on the questionnaire, and qualitative data from short-answer questions and interviews with 36 participants is also considered.
Access to French education varies: Some parishes offer French instruction, or even French immersion, from elementary through high school, but French is limited to high school in others. Positive attitudes toward Cajun French are generally in evidence, but widespread French ability has not been achieved through educational programs. Results indicate that students who self-identify as Cajun express interest in learning Cajun French, and students with the greatest amount of French education display a willingness to use French (e.g., in the workplace). Thus, more extensive French education for students who self-identify as Cajun may be the best hope for the continued existence of Cajun French in South Louisiana.},

Those dialects are Pedagogical French, an international language, Cajun French, an obsolescing language, and Mississippi Gulf Coast French, an extinct language. In order to determine the degree of variation, thirty-two lexical items or phrases that display variance with Pedagogical French are selected from Mississippi Gulf Coast French. They are then compared with counterparts in Pedagogical French and Cajun French to determine the amount of variance between dialects.
I hypothesized that there is a larger degree of variation between the Gulf Coast dialects and Pedagogical French than between the Gulf Coast dialects themselves. This proved not to be the case. While Mississippi Gulf Coast French does display more similarities with Cajun French than Pedagogical French based on the biased sample, Cajun French demonstrates more similarities with Pedagogical French than with Mississippi Gulf Coast French. This, coupled with the large number of English loan words that has made their way into the Mississippi Gulf Coast French lexicon, leads to the conclusion that Mississippi Gulf Coast French has undergone significant language change during its last years. Due to the declining number of speakers, and the fact that those final speakers were bilingual, English heavily influenced Mississippi Gulf Coast French in its final years of use. As this did not occur with Cajun French, it remained closer to Pedagogical French.},

Some of the main introductory textbooks dealing with this discipline hardly mention style as a variable, and, when they do, they usually understand style as a reflection of the speaker’s attention to his/her own speech. Contrary to this tradition, two main approaches have been proposed. First, in the Audience Design model [Bell, A., 1984. Language style as audience design. Language in Society 13, 145–204] stylistic variation is seen as the result of an adaptation to the features of a present or absent audience. Second, in the so-called Speaker Design model, stylistic variation is seen as a process of identity building. In our study, we analyse the speech of a radio presenter in a local station in Murcia and compare it to the audience’s linguistic behaviour as shown in the phone calls received during the programme. We also analyse the data obtained in an interview with the radio presenter. Our results, which show a radical divergence between the presenter’s speech and that of his audience, are contrasted with both Audience Design and Speaker Design theoretical tenets, using the explicit knowledge of the presenter’s attitudes and opinions to contrast theory and fact. We conclude that neither model offers a completely satisfactory explanation of the patterns found. Finally, we reflect on the need to consider not only performance, but also the script (in the form of a professional voice used following a particular linguistic policy based on sociolinguistic norms and attitudes to language) that condition the individual linguistic behaviour, thus suggesting the need to consider community-specific factors in the explanation of stylistic variation.},

It takes up ideas on concept-formation and hypostatization put forward in the philosophy of language, word-formation and lexical semantics and relates them to recent evidence on the processing and storage of nonce-formations and recently coined complex words collected by psycholinguists and neurolinguists. The role of frequency of exposure and semantic transparency in the increasing entrenchment of concepts in language users' memories is discussed. Effects of hypostatization – the subjective impression that the existence of a word suggests the existence of a class of things denoted by the word – are shown to be very strong even in the early phases of the establishment of new words, and pragmatic exploitations of these effects are explored.},

	abstract = {Traditionally speaking, the study of variation in English has generally pursued a path separate from and not always parallel to that of "mainstream" linguistics, especially when it came to matters of theoretical interest. Shortly after the transformational-generative revolution in 1957, however, it became clear that this could no longer be the case if the theory-building enterprise was to succeed, for the T-G myth of a completely homogeneous speech community placed serious obstacles in the way of making significant general statements about language. Linguistic heterogeneity, many linguists concluded, insofar as it was patterned, had to be considered a part of human linguistic competence and accounted for in the theory of language.
In 1968, David DeCamp suggested that that variation had a primarily qualitative basis. In many cases, he claimed, it was possible to make general implicational statements of the form: "If a speaker uses linguistic feature A, he also uses feature B, and if B, then C, and so forth." Overall patterns such as this would, if verified, clarify many phenomena which were customarily dismissed as intractable or chaotic and make possible a very elegant theoretical account of linguistic heterogeneity, that is, dialects, stylistic varieties, individual language differences, etc.
Though he did not know it at the time of his proposal, DeCamp had hit on a form of data analysis known as scalogram analysis, which had actually been developed during World War II and considerably refined since then by measurement theorists and social and behavioral scientists. It took several years for linguists to learn of the coincidence, and when they did, they generally overlooked the readily available body of enlightening and cautionary literature that these non-linguists had produced.
My thesis attempts to correct this oversight by examining these neglected writings and by adapting and coordinating a set of rigorous statistical and methodological standards for judging the operational adequacy of any given implicational or scalogram analysis. That is, the central question which this dissertation tries to answer is whether the data arrays advanced by "qualitative" linguists actually form "scales" in the operationally accepted Guttman sense; this is equivalent to testing whether the claimed implicational relations are stable and significant enough to necessitate a formal theoretical account. Also, since the technique of scalogram analysis is basically a form of measurement, the findings derived from the application of rigorous scale criteria provide, in most cases, a reliable test of the empirical foundations of the theoretical inferences that a given qualitative analysis may motivate. In critiques of ten representative scalar studies I found serious difficulties with claims of significant implicational patterning and called into question the theoretical assertions to which they correspond. These assertions ranged from rather localized issues such as postulated underlying syntactic structures to broader considerations of which overall model of linguistic variation to prefer on the basis of observational and descriptive adequacy.},

I will then turn to the issue of whether the properties of the functional sequence (ordering, cooccurrence restrictions) are amenable to 'further explanations' in terms of more basic principles constraining linguistic computations. I will argue that the search for deeper explanations is an integral part of the cartographic endeavour: it presupposes the establishment of reliable maps, and nourishes the pursuit of further cartographic questions. I will conclude by illustrating the issue of further explanation by comparing certain properties of topicalization in English and Italian, in particular the fact that DP topics are fundamentally unique in English, while they can be freely reiterated in Italian.

The present study investigated whether syntactic information is shared by testing if syntactic priming occurs between languages.

We found that a participant who had just heard a sentence in Spanish tended to use the same type of sentence when describing the next card in English. In particular, English passives were considerably more common following a Spanish passive than otherwise. We use the results to extend current models of the representation of grammatical information to bilinguals.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution.

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.},

	abstract = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the “wrong” answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.},

We further argue that simple networks such as these cannot capture variation in the strength of collaborative ties and propose a measure of collaboration strength based on the number of papers coauthored by pairs of scientists, and the number of other scientists with whom they coauthored those papers.},

Under-and oversocialized accounts are paradoxically similar in their neglect of ongoing structures of social relations, and a sophisticated account of economic action must consider its embeddedness in such structures.

However, the existing centrality measures are not adequate in network percolation scenarios (such as during infection transmission in a social network of individuals, spreading of computer viruses on computer networks, or transmission of disease over a network of towns) because they do not account for the changing percolation states of individual nodes. We propose a new measure, percolation centrality, that quantifies relative impact of nodes based on their topological connectivity, as well as their percolation states. The measure can be extended to include random walk based definitions, and its computational complexity is shown to be of the same order as that of betweenness centrality. We demonstrate the usage of percolation centrality by applying it to a canonical network as well as simulated and real world scale-free and random networks.},

This convergence property may be used as the basis of an algorithm (CONCOR) for hierarchical clustering. The CONCOR procedure is applied to several illustrative sets of social network data and is found to give results that are highly compatible with analyses and interpretations of the same data using the blockmodel approach of White ( White, Boorman \& Breiger, 1976 ).

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.},

	abstract = {Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others — a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.},

On the one hand, we observed a clustering effect around shared political views among supporters of the same party in the Twitter communication network, suggesting that there are pockets of political polarization on Twitter. At the same time, there was evidence of cross-ideological connections and exchanges, which may facilitate open, cross-party, and cross-ideological discourse, and ignite wider debate and learning as they are observed by nonaffiliated voters and the media at large. However, what appeared to be far less likely was any increased willingness or tendency for committed partisans to shift their allegiances as a result of their Twitter engagements, and we postulate that Twitter usage at present is likely to further embed partisan loyalties during electoral periods rather than loosen them; a dynamic that would seemingly contribute to political polarization.},

All dialects that have completely lost this contrast also lack palatalization. Why are there no /i, a, u/ dialects in which all instances of surface [i] trigger palatalization? We propose that this typological gap can be explained using a contrastivist analysis whereby only contrastive features can be phonologically active, palatalization is triggered by [coronal], and contrastive features are assigned in an order placing [low] and [labial] ahead of [coronal]. In a three-vowel inventory only [low] and [labial] are contrastive, while in the four-vowel inventory [coronal] must also be contrastive to distinguish strong and weak i. It follows from these assumptions that [i] can trigger palatalization only if it is in contrast with a fourth vowel. (English)},

In this paper I review existing literature on bilingual Inuit children to explore the prospects for the survival of Inuktitut given the increase in the use of English in these regions. Studies on code mixing and subject realization among simultaneous bilingual children ages 2–4 years show a strong foundation in Inuktitut, regardless of extensive exposure to English in the home. However, three studies of older Inuit children exposed to English through school reveal some stagnation in children's Inuktitut and increasing use of English with age, even in nonschool contexts. I conclude that current choices about language use at the personal, school, and societal levels will determine whether Inuit are able to reach and maintain stable bilingualism, or whether Inuktitut will decline significantly in favor of majority languages.},

Based on observation and interviews with Inuit, anglophone, and francophone respondents, it seeks to understand how language behavior may be understood as an expression of Inuit identity. The description outlines a few salient points of the present-day linguistic situation in the Baffin Region: the role played by English as a lingua franca (common language); an apparent correlation between schooling and a decreasing use of Inuktitut in daily life (high school students and educated adults speak much less Inuktitut than less educated individuals); and, at the same time, the strength of the aboriginal language, which is still widely spoken and routinely transmitted to the new Inuit generations. Opinions of Inuit informants on the usefulness and importance of each language reveal the existence of a dichotomy of sorts. English is deemed more useful than Inuktitut, because it paves the way to better employment and opens a window on the wider world, but Inuktitut is generally perceived as essential in defining Inuit identity. Many think that with the advent of Nunavut, Inuktitut will become a prerequisite for holding a job, thus increasing its practical usefulness.},

Half lived in communities with relatively high exposure to the majority language (English), while the other half lived in communities with low exposure. One third of each group were in Grade 3 (first year of school exposure to majority language), one third in Grade 8/9 (sixth year of school exposure) and one third were adults. Each participant narrated a 24-page wordless picture book (Frog Story) in Inuktitut. Narrations were analysed for story length, lexical diversity, grammatical complexity and narrative structure – all measures that are expected to increase or show improvement with increased language ability. Results are inconclusive; some suggest that higher exposure to English leads to stagnation in Inuktitut, while others do not.

This process presented numerous challenges, from choosing citation forms in a polysynthetic language to dealing with a lack of word frequency data. Twenty heritage receptive bilinguals (RBs) with very limited production skills in Inuttitut (their first language) and a comparison group of eight fluent bilinguals (FBs) participated in our study. Since the RBs lacked production skills in Inuttitut, the lexical test required participants to translate a carefully compiled list of Inuttitut nouns and verbs into English. The results revealed that RBs had good comprehension of basic vocabulary (85\% accuracy), but differed significantly from FBs, mostly because the RBs had a number of partially accurate translations. The three lowest scoring RBs had the highest number of such translations as well as inaccurate translations based on phonological associations, as is common in emergent lexicons. This lexical test correlates with grammatical proficiency measures, pointing to its potential value as a quick placement and diagnostic test in revitalization programs for Inuttitut as well as other languages in a language loss situation.},

A grammaticality judgment study suggests that RBs possess sensitivity to morphosyntactic violations, though to a lesser degree than fluent bilinguals. Low-proficiency RBs are sensitive only to the most basic grammatical properties. Case omission is most difficult to detect, but morphemes bearing incorrect features (case oversuppliance, number agreement mismatch) or ordered incorrectly (tense and agreement, tense and negation) are easier, and performance on incorrect ordering of morphemes is near target with the core agreement morpheme for all RBs. While receptive bilinguals show patterns of grammatical deficits, they also demonstrate clear knowledge of the basic properties of word structure in Inuttitut. This has implications both for the psycholinguistics of bilingualism and for language revitalization efforts.},

	abstract = {Background: Pharmaceutical communication is an essential component of pharmaceutical health care, optimally ensuring patients understand the proper administration and side effects of their medications. Communication can often be complicated by language and culture, but with pharmaceuticals, misunderstandings can prove particularly harmful. In Nunavut, to ensure the preservation and revitalization of Inuit languages, the Inuit Language Protection Act and Official Languages Act were passed requiring that all public and private sector essential services offer verbal and written communication in Inuit languages (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) by 2012.; Methods: While the legislation mandates compliance, policy implementation for pharmaceutical services is problematic. Not a single pharmacist in Nunavut is fluent in either of the Inuit languages. Pharmacists have indicated challenges in formally translating written documentation into Inuit languages based on concerns for patient safety. These challenges of negotiating the joint requirements of language legislation and patient safety have resulted in pharmacies using verbal on-site translation as a tenuous solution regardless of its many limitations.; Results: The complex issues of pharmaceutical health care and communication among the Inuit of Nunavut are best examined through multimethod research to encompass a wide range of perspectives. This methodology combines the richness of ethnographic data, the targeted depth of interviews with key informants and the breadth of cross-Canada policy and financial analyses.; Conclusions: The analysis of this information would provide valuable insights into the current relationships between health care providers, pharmacists and Inuit patients and suggest future directions for policy that will improve the efficacy of pharmaceuticals and health care spending for the Inuit in Canada.;},

Using data from a participatory, activity-oriented, ethnographic project at an Inuit family literacy centre, we argue that state-driven language policies have opened up spaces for Indigenous-defined language and literacy learning activities that can shape and be shaped by family language policies. This has permitted some urban groups in Canada to define their own literacy needs in order to develop effective family language policies. Drawing on two Inuit-centred literacy activities, we demonstrate how literacy practices are embedded in intergenerational sharing of Inuit experience, cultural memory, and stories and how these are associated spatially, culturally, and materially with objects and representations. We thus show how Inuit-centred literacy practices can be a driving force for family language policy, linking people to an urban Inuit educational community centre and to their urban and Arctic Inuit families and homelands.},

No significant differences between the trained singers and untrained singers were observed. In addition, no task differences occurred for the /b/ productions. The results indicated that the type of phonatory task influences VOT for voiceless stops in females.

This investigation aims at describing voice function of four nonclassical styles of singing, Rock, Pop, Soul, and Swedish Dance Band. A male singer, professionally experienced in performing in these genres, sang representative tunes, both with their original lyrics and on the syllable /pae/. In addition, he sang tones in a triad pattern ranging from the pitch Bb2 to the pitch C4 on the syllable /pae/ in pressed and neutral phonation. An expert panel was successful in classifying the samples, thus suggesting that the samples were representative of the various styles. Subglottal pressure was estimated from oral pressure during the occlusion for the consonant [p]. Flow glottograms were obtained from inverse filtering. The four lowest formant frequencies differed between the styles. The mean of the subglottal pressure and the mean of the normalized amplitude quotient (NAQ), that is, the ratio between the flow pulse amplitude and the product of period and maximum flow declination rate, were plotted against the mean of fundamental frequency. In these graphs, Rock and Swedish Dance Band assumed opposite extreme positions with respect to subglottal pressure and mean phonation frequency, whereas the mean NAQ values differed less between the styles.},

The 36 performances were analyzed with a long-term average spectrum (LTAS) method from which direct effects of the pitch distribution were removed. After factoring out each singer’s average, the 36 pitch-corrected LTAS contours were reduced to a two-dimensional representation in two ways: (1) a principal-component analysis and (2) a graphical plot of spectral slope versus speaker’s formant strength. Both ways clearly separate the three styles. The spectrum of the klapa style turns out to be similar to that of speech. The ojkanje style is extremely loud and shows two spectral peaks: a sharp one tuned at twice the fundamental frequency and appropriate for long-distance communication on mountain slopes, and a broad one around 3.5 kHz, reminiscent of a speaker’s formant. The tarankanje style has a very flat spectrum implemented by vocal pressedness and nasality, which is appropriate for blending into or imitating the timbral characteristics of the sopile folk instrument.},

Several stylized vocal tract shapes (caricatures) are discussed that form the bases of these styles. It is hypothesized that operatic singing uses vowels that are modified toward an inverted megaphone mouth shape for transitioning into the high-pitch range. This allows all the harmonics except the fundamental to be “lifted” over the first formant. Belting, on the other hand, uses vowels that are consistently modified toward the megaphone (trumpet-like) mouth shape. Both the fundamental and the second harmonic are then kept below the first formant. The vocal tract shapes provide collective reinforcement to multiple harmonics in the form of inertive supraglottal reactance and compliant subglottal reactance. Examples of lip openings from four well-known artists are used to infer vocal tract area functions and the corresponding reactances.},

This study examined trained singers' and untrained singers' (nonsingers') sensitivity to subtle manipulations in auditory feedback and the subsequent effect on the mapping between F0 feedback and vocal control.

Results showed that singers and nonsingers compensated to a similar degree when presented with frequency-altered feedback (FAF); however, singers' F0 values were consistently closer to the intended pitch target. Moreover, singers initiated their compensatory responses when auditory feedback was shifted up or down 6 cents or more, compared to nonsingers who began compensating when feedback was shifted up 26 cents and down 22 cents. Additionally, examination of the first 50 ms of vocalization indicated that participants commenced subsequent vocal utterances, during FAF, near the F0 value on previous shift trials. Interestingly, nonsingers commenced F0 productions below the pitch target and increased their F0 until they matched the note. Thus, singers and nonsingers rely on an internal model to regulate voice F0, but singers' models appear to be more sensitive in response to subtle discrepancies in auditory feedback.},

	abstract = {Five premier male country singers involved in our previous studies spoke and sang the words of both the national anthem and a country song of their choice. Long-term-average spectra were made of the spoken and sung material of each singer. The spectral characteristics of county singers' speech and singing were similar. A prominent peak in the upper part of the spectrum, previously described as the “speaker's formant,” was found in the county singers' speech and singing. The singer's formant, a strong spectral peak near 2.8 kHz, an important part of the spectrum of classically trained singers, was not found in the spectra of the country singers. The results support the conclusion that the resonance characteristics in speech and singing are similar in country singing and that county singing is not characterized by a singer's formant.},

Signals of the sound pressure level, electroglottograph, and mean esophageal pressure are recorded, and similar maneuvers by the same subjects are examined stroboscopically. The lyric voice is found to make a gradual diminuendo while maintaining nearly constant posture of the vocal tract together with a phase of complete closure in the glottal cycle. The robust voice, by contrast, passes abruptly from a production of high subglottal pressure and a high closed quotient to one of low pressure and incomplete closure, and the transition is marked by a sudden opening of the previously constricted laryngeal collar. It is proposed that the mode of soft voice production demonstrated by the robust voice be recognized as a distinct register of the singing voice.},

Vocal fold vibrations were observed with high-speed photography, using a computerized recording system. The spectral characteristics of the sound signal were analyzed. Kymographic image data were compared to the sound signal and flow inverse filtering data from the same singer were obtained on a separate occasion. It was found that the vocal folds vibrated at the same frequency throughout both modes of singing. During throat singing the ventricular folds vibrated with complete but short closures at half the frequency of the true vocal folds, covering every second vocal fold closure. Kymographic data confirmed the findings. The spectrum contained added subharmonics compared to modal voice. In the inverse filtered signal the amplitude of every second airflow pulse was considerably lowered. The ventricular folds appeared to modulate the sound by reducing the glottal flow of every other vocal fold vibratory cycle.},

	abstract = {Summary
The considerable voice timbre differences between musical theater (MT) and western operatic singers are analyzed with respect to voice source and formant frequencies in five representatives of each singer group. Audio, subglottal pressure (Psub), and electroglottograph (EGG) signals were recorded while the subjects sang a sequence of [pae:] syllables starting at maximal vocal loudness and then gradually decreasing vocal loudness. The task was performed at each of two fundamental frequencies (F0), approximately one octave apart. Ten equally spaced Psub values were then selected for each F0. The subsequent vowels were analyzed in terms of flow glottograms derived by inverse filtering the audio signal, which also yielded formant frequency data. Period time (T0), peak-to-peak pulse amplitude (Up-t-p), and maximum flow declination rate (MFDR) were measured from the flow glottograms while closed quotient Qclosed (Tcl/T0) was determined in combination with the differentiated EGG signal. Also the relationship between the first and the second harmonic in the spectrum (H1–H2), the amplitude quotient (AQ), that is, the ratio between Up-t-p and MFDR, and normalized AQ, that is, AQ normalized with respect to period time was calculated as well as the sound pressure level. The results showed that both the MT and the opera singers varied their Psub systematically, approximately doubling Psub for a doubling of F0. For a given value of Psub, the MT singers produced higher values of MFDR, Up-t-p, and Qclosed, and lower values of H1–H2, indicating a weaker fundamental. Further, the MT singers showed higher formant frequencies and did not show the opera singers' characteristic clustering of F3, F4, and F5.},

	abstract = {The human singing and speech spectrum includes energy above 5 kHz. To begin an in-depth exploration of this high-frequency energy (HFE), a database of anechoic high-fidelity recordings of singers and talkers was created and analyzed. Third-octave band analysis from the long-term average spectra showed that production level (soft vs normal vs loud), production mode (singing vs speech), and phoneme (for voiceless fricatives) all significantly affected HFE characteristics. Specifically, increased production level caused an increase in absolute HFE level, but a decrease in relative HFE level. Singing exhibited higher levels of HFE than speech in the soft and normal conditions, but not in the loud condition. Third-octave band levels distinguished phoneme class of voiceless fricatives. Female HFE levels were significantly greater than male levels only above 11 kHz. This information is pertinent to various areas of acoustics, including vocal tract modeling, voice synthesis, augmentative hearing technology (hearing aids and cochlear implants), and training/therapy for singing and speech.},

Due to subtle interclan dialect variation, a married woman may have different dialect features than her husband and other local villagers. This study presents an acoustic analysis of such clan-level variation in lexical tone, a sociotonetic analysis. Results show that the immigrant women maintain the tone variants of their home clan dialects to a high degree despite spending a decade or more in the husband's village, thus illustrating a case where linguistic identity is maintained in the face of close, long-term contact.},

We move into the physical domain, where theories and hypotheses can be tested against observations of the physical reality. Here new foundations are laid that are fully consonant with modern science as practiced in physics, chemistry, and biology.On these foundations is built a structure of testable specific dynamic causal laws of communicative behavior that provides support for treating previously recalcitrant context-dependent semantic, pragmatic, interactive, rhetorical, and literary phenomena. The central role of context in the foundations of the theory provides the insights of scientific lawfulness while still honoring the particularity of situations celebrated in the humanities.},

Empirically wide-ranging - Humboldt goes far beyond the Indo-European family of languages - it remains one of the most interesting and important attempts to draw philosophical conclusions from comparative linguistics. This 1999 volume presents a translation by Peter Heath, together with an introduction by Michael Losonsky that places Humboldt's work in its historical context and discusses its relevance to contemporary work in philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science, and psychology.},

People, however, rarely have global knowledge of the states of others, but must estimate them from the local observations of their social contacts. Network structure can significantly distort individual’s local observations. Under some conditions, a state that is globally rare in a network may be dramatically over-represented in the local neighborhoods of many individuals. This effect, which we call the “majority illusion,” leads individuals to systematically overestimate the prevalence of that state, which may accelerate the spread of social contagions. We develop a statistical model that quantifies this effect and validate it with measurements in synthetic and real-world networks. We show that the illusion is exacerbated in networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution and disassortative structure.},

This article shows that, if individuals compare themselves with their friends, it is likely that most of them will feel relatively inadequate. Data on friendship drawn from James Coleman's (1961) classic study The Adolescent Society are used to illustratite the phenomenon that most people have fewer friends have. The logic underlying the phenomenon is mathematically explored, showing that the mean number of friends of friends is always greater than the mean number of friends of individuals. Further analysis shows that the proportion of individuals who have fewer friends than the mean number of friends their own friends have is affected by the exact arrangement fo friendships in a social network. This disproportionate experiencing of friends with many friends is related to a set of abstractly similar "class size paradoxes" that includes such diverse phenomena as the tendencies for college students to experience the mean class size as larger than it actually is and for people to experience beaches and parks as more crowded than they usually are.},

	abstract = {Models of collective behavior are developed for situations where actors have two alternatives and the costs and/or benefits of each depend on how many other actors choose which alternative. The key concept is that of "threshold": the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so; this is the point where net benefits begin to exceed net costs for that particular actor. Beginning with a frequency distribution of thresholds, the models allow calculation of the ultimate or "equilibrium" number making each decision. The stability of equilibrium results against various possible changes in threshold distributions is considered. Stress is placed on the importance of exact distributions distributions for outcomes. Groups with similar average preferences may generate very different results; hence it is hazardous to infer individual dispositions from aggregate outcomes or to assume that behavior was directed by ultimately agreed-upon norms. Suggested applications are to riot behavior, innovation and rumor diffusion, strikes, voting, and migration. Issues of measurement, falsification, and verification are discussed.},

We obtain exact solutions for a simple version of the model, finding that under general conditions only three classes of collective dynamics exist. Furthermore, we find that, for a given length of memory, the class into which a particular system falls is determined by only two parameters. Our model suggests novel measures for assessing the susceptibility of a population to large contagion events, and also a possible strategy for inhibiting or facilitating them.},

It suggests that a transformation of linguistic differences into ethnolect-codes quickly falls prey to homogenizing groups and their language use, obscures speakers' styling practices as well as the relations between “ethnolect” and standard language speakers. Furthermore, “ethnolect” as an analytical concept buttresses the idea that linguistic practices are caused by ethnicity, when it is more likely to assume language use is shaped by how speakers interpret prevailing representations of ethnicity and style their language use in relation to that. As an alternative, I argue that ethnolects be viewed as representations of particular ways of speaking that do not necessarily correspond to systematic linguistic practices. Sociolinguists therefore need to investigate how local and general perceptions of ways of speaking lead to specific styling practices...},

HPSG provides an integration of key ideas from the various disciplines of cognitive science, drawing on results from diverse approaches to syntactic theory, situation semantics, data type theory, and knowledge representation. The result is a conception of grammar as a set of declarative and order-independent constraints, a conception well suited to modelling human language processing.  This self-contained volume demonstrates the applicability of the HPSG approach to a wide range of empirical problems, including a number which have occupied center-stage within syntactic theory for well over twenty years: the control of "understood" subjects, long-distance dependencies conventionally treated in terms of wh-movement, and syntactic constraints on the relationship between various kinds of pronouns and their antecedents. The authors make clear how their approach compares with and improves upon approaches undertaken in other frameworks, including in particular the government-binding theory of Noam Chomsky.},

Questionnaire data were collected in 1,899 families in which at least one of the parents spoke a language other than the majority language. Each questionnaire asked about the home language use of a family consisting of at least one parent and one child between the ages of 6 and 10 years old. The results show that the children in these families all spoke the majority language, but that minority language use was not universal. Differences in parental language input patterns used at home correlated with differences in child minority language use. Home input patterns where both parents used the minority language and where at most one parent spoke the majority language had a high chance of success. The "one parent-one language" strategy did not provide a necessary nor sufficient input condition. Implications for bilingual families are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Summary
The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between undergraduate vocal music majors' diction acquisition abilities for singing in a nonnative language (as rated both by themselves and by their studio voice teachers) and their scores on an objective test of phonemic and stress perception. Ten students with varying levels of university voice training served as participants. The results showed significant negative correlations between each of the teachers' four ratings and the students' scores on the phonemic awareness subtest. In addition, 20\% of the students demonstrated evidence of underdeveloped phonemic awareness skills, as indicated by their below average test performance. Considerable individual differences were also observed in the students' abilities to track phonemes within a sequence of phonemes, count and track syllables within a sequence of syllables, and track combinations of phoneme and syllable changes in sequence, as evidenced by subtest performance scores. These findings corroborate existing reports which indicate that approximately 30\% of the population does not fully develop phonemic awareness skills in the absence of special training. The findings support the utility of this objective test of phonemic and stress perception as a means of identifying students who will have difficulty with diction acquisition, and point to possibilities for pretraining to improve their response to diction instruction.},

Here, we introduce a novel Cognition-driven Social Network (CogSNet) model that accounts for cognitive aspects of social perception and explicitly represents human memory dynamics.

We compare results of an experimental task that directly elicits participants' sense of the indexical value of /aw/-monophthongization with the occurrence of this variant in the same people's speech. People who hear monophthongal /aw/ as an index of localness are unlikely to have this feature in their own speech, and many of the people who do monophthongize /aw/ do not associate this variant with localness. Exploring how four of these participants talk about this feature and its meanings, we show that the indexical meanings of speech features can vary widely within a community, and we illustrate the danger of confusing the meaning assigned by hearers to a linguistic form with the meaning users would assign to it. We suggest that a phenomenological approach, attending to the multiplicity and indeterminacy of indexical relations and to how such relations arise historically and in lived experience, can lead to a more nuanced account of the distribution of social meanings of variant forms than can studies of perception or production alone.},

As teenagers, they used morpho-syntactic features of AAVE voraciously. But as working adults, these women distance themselves from their teenage activities and social networks, and display a considerably reduced vernacular usage that accords with their articulated concern to get ahead. The diachronic interpretation that best characterizes their transformation is age-grading rather than generational change, since change at the individual level is accompanied by stability at the community level. The picture is complicated by intermediate recordings showing that one of the speakers is a stylistic chameleon, capable since her teenage years of varying copula absence rates depending on addressee, topic, and projected persona. But the age-grading interpretation of change at the individual level remains valid based on the evidence of her reduced use of habitual be2, and third singular present tense -s absence. The case highlights the importance of paying more attention to stylistic variation and including more than two time points in sociolinguistic studies of change in real and apparent time. (English)},

American English tweets. People vary in their use of eyes, mouth shape, face direction, and whether or not
they represent a nose in the face. And we see these in groups other than smiles—in variants of frowns and
winks, for example. This paper focuses on nose and non-nose users, demonstrating that the variants
correspond to different types of users, tweeting with different vocabularies. Emoticons are not simply
representations of internal emotional states. They are more interactive in nature, positioning authors and
audiences around propositions. The meaning of a given emoticon goes beyond its affective stance. For
example, emoticons have variants that have greater or lesser affinities to standard language. Researchers who
are interested in style, stance, affect, computer mediated communication, variation, context, and sentiment
analysis will find ample grist for their mills.},

people, is the process of inheritance that underlies linguistic evolution. To understand
how language transmission works we need a mechanistic understanding based on
empirical evidence of lasting change of language usage. Here, we analysed 200
million online conversations to investigate transmission between individuals. We
 nd that frequency of word usage is inherited over conversations, not just the binary
presence or absence of a word in a person's lexicon. We propose a mechanism for
transmission whereby for each word someone encounters there is a chance they will
use it more often. Using this mechanism, we measure that for one word in around
every hundred someone encounters, they will use that word more frequently. Since
more commonly used words are encountered more often, this means that it is the
frequencies of words which are copied. Beyond this, our measurements indicate that
this per-encounter mechanism is neutral and applies without any further distinction
as to whether a word encountered in a conversation is commonly used or not. An
important consequence of this is that frequencies of many words can be used in
concert to observe and measure language transmission, and our results con rm this.
These results indicate that our mechanism for transmission can be used to study
language patterns and evolution within populations.},

It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations.

First, the content of peoples interactions consists of a preponderance of subjective, evaluative statements, dominated by the use of pronouns, copulas and intransitive clauses. Second, the frequency with which certain items and strings of items are used has a profound influence on the way language is broken up into chunks in memory storage, the way such chunks are related to other stored material and the ease with which they are accessed to produce new utterances.},

For Poplack the distinction is based on linguistic integration and for Myers-Scotton on frequency. We show how what is a definition for one is a hypothesis for the other, and vice versa. Overcoming this apparent incommensurability requires a theory-independent approach in which we define the unit of analysis as “donor-language items” rather than switches or borrowings. Using this unit of analysis in the analysis of English-origin verbs in a Welsh corpus, we examine the assumptions behind the contrasting definitions of CS vs. borrowing. First we consider whether it is possible to identify linguistic integration in an unequivocal, categorical way and secondly whether linguistic integration is related to frequency of usage. We show that the identification of linguistic integration depends on the test used and that both frequency of usage and listedness play roles in the integration of English donor-language items in Welsh. In this way we argue that we achieve a theory-independent approach and go some way towards overcoming incommensurability.},

	abstract = {Many real-world networks are representations of dynamic systems with interactions that change over time, often in uncoordinated ways and at irregular intervals. For example, university students connect in intermittent groups that repeatedly form and dissolve based on multiple factors, including their lectures, interests, and friends. Such dynamic systems can be represented as multilayer networks where each layer represents a snapshot of the temporal network. In this representation, it is crucial that the links between layers accurately capture real dependencies between those layers. Often, however, these dependencies are unknown. Therefore, current methods connect layers based on simplistic assumptions that cannot capture node-level layer dependencies. For example, connecting every node to itself in other layers with the same weight can wipe out essential dependencies between intermittent groups, making it difficult or even impossible to identify them. In this paper, we present a principled approach to estimating node-level layer dependencies based on the network structure within each layer. We implement our node-level coupling method in the community detection framework Infomap and demonstrate its performance compared to current methods on synthetic and real temporal networks. We show that our approach more effectively constrains information inside multilayer communities so that Infomap can better recover planted groups in multilayer benchmark networks that represent multiple modes with different groups and better identify intermittent communities in real temporal contact networks. These results suggest that node-level layer coupling can improve the modeling of information spreading in temporal networks and better capture their dynamic community structure.},

We then surveyed perceptions of cohesion, and computed group density and size using social network analysis. Out of six linear mixed effects models specified, a random intercept and fixed slope model with group size as a predictor of perceived group cohesion emerged as best fitting. Whereas group density was not linked to perceived cohesion, size had a small negative effect on perceived cohesion, suggesting that people perceive smaller groups as more cohesive. We discuss the potential of social network analysis, visualization tools, and Facebook data for advancing research on groups.},

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between‐group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications for creativity and structural change.},

Nevertheless, organizations tend to rely on the latter in their attempts to understand and improve work practice. We examine one such study. We then relate its conclusions to compatible investigations of learning and of innovation to argue that conventional descriptions of jobs mask not only the ways people work, but also significant learning and innovation generated in the informal communities-of-practice in which they work. By reassessing work, learning, and innovation in the context of actual communities and actual practices, we suggest that the connections between these three become apparent. With a unified view of working, learning, and innovating, it should be possible to reconceive of and redesign organizations to improve all three.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics such as language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics such as age. As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Gödel’s sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and may help explain why our physical laws appear so simple.

Regarded as a classic, and widely quoted, it has continued to arouse interest. Here now is his Creation Revisited, which retains the unsettling mixture of reductionist attitude and poetic style of the earlier work. Written for a wide readership, it is an engrossing exploration of the truly great questions of existence, such as why there are three dimension of space, why there is only one direction of time, how matter can emerge from nothing, and - what many regard as beyond our grasp - whether it is possible to speculate scientifically on the events that preceded the creation. Peter Atkins approaches these and other fundamental questions on the nature of the universe, and how it came into being without external intervention, with the view that there is nothing that cannot be understood. The path to our understanding is to peel away appearances to expose a core, a core which is always of unsurpassed simplicity.

Ainsi, à l’aide du corpus Mougeon et Beniak, recueilli en 1978 au moyen d’entrevues enregistrées, il scrute les divers emplois des conjonctions ça fait que, so, alors et donc dans le parler des adolescents de North-Bay, Pembroke, Cornwall et Hawkesbury, en Ontario, qu’il met en rapport avec ceux des locuteurs montréalais, au Québec. L’auteur examine l’alternance entre ces quatre conjonctions en fonction de divers facteurs : la localité, l’appartenance socio-économique, le sexe, la fréquence de l’emploi du français et le registre (sujet abordé dans l’entrevue). Il relève des divergences dans l’emploi de ces marqueurs : par exemple, la tournure typique du français vernaculaire ( ça fait que ) est mieux préservée dans les communautés majoritaires ; une pression normative plus faible rend les minorités tolérantes à l’anglais et explique l’emprunt, plus ou moins fréquent de la conjonction so selon le milieu et la condition des locuteurs ; chez ceux qui sous-utilisent le français, on observe une tendance à la standardisation (emploi plus fréquent d’alors et de donc ).},

We present cross-linguistic evidence that these mechanisms also operate in bidialectals. Thirty-two native German speakers who sometimes use the Öcher Platt dialect, and thirty-two native English speakers who sometimes use the Dundonian Scots dialect completed a dialect-switching task. Naming latencies were higher for switch than for non-switch trials, and lower for cognate compared to non-cognate nouns. Switch costs were symmetrical, regardless of whether participants actively used the dialect or not. In contrast, sixteen monodialectal English speakers, who performed the dialect-switching task after being trained on the Dundonian words, showed asymmetrical switch costs with longer latencies when switching back into Standard English. These results are reminiscent of findings for balanced vs. unbalanced bilinguals, and suggest that monolingual dialect speakers can recruit control mechanisms in similar ways as bilinguals.},

Some of the findings, for example that rare words are more prone to random drift than common ones, are perhaps not surprising. However, selection for the irregular forms of some verbs tends to buck the usual assumption of regularization over time, and might be related to changing frequencies of rhyming patterns. The findings suggest a more important role for random processes in language evolution than previously considered.},

In fact, historical changes to both Cajun and Creole identities have led to today’s conflation of terms that belies a much more complex state of affairs featuring considerable linguistic diversity. Furthermore, the focus on these two terms has ignored a third group of Francophones, American Indians. Linguistic fieldwork reveals that Cajuns, Creoles, and Indians all express their identities by manipulating the language differently, but that labels given are not always reliable indicators of the type of French spoken.},

Thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution. Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimization of society as a whole. We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency—the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that knowledge of the time commitment of members to a given community can be used for estimating the community’s lifetime. These findings offer insight into the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

A static community detection algorithm and a dynamic community evolution algorithm are included in the approach. At first, communities are initialized by constructing the core nodes chains, the nodes can be iteratively searched and divided into corresponding communities via the static community detection algorithm. For a dynamic network, an evolutionary process is divided into three phases, and behaviors of community evolution can be judged according to the changing situation of the core nodes chain in each community. Experiments show that the proposed approach can achieve accuracy and availability in the synthetic and real world networks.},

	abstract = {Le sentiment général à l'égard du français québécois oral, en particulier pour son aspect statut social, n'atteindrait toujours pas en matière d'appréciation la place réservée au français européen, notamment chez la population immigrante de Montréal qui le jugerait moins favorablement que sa contrepartie hexagonale (Kircher, 2012). Au Québec, le français de France et celui de Paris, plus particulièrement, ont par le passé été désignés comme les modèles du « bon français », alors que la variété québécoise a souvent hérité de jugements négatifs, d'un statut de langue non standard ou encore a été perçue comme une variété peu, ou pas prestigieuse (Lambert et coll., 1960; Lambert, 1967; d'Anglejan et Tucker, 1973; Lappin, 1982; Bouchard, 2002; Maurais, 2008; Kircher, 2012). Aujourd'hui encore, le débat n'est pas clos sur la nature endogène ou exogène que devrait revêtir la norme linguistique québécoise (Maurais, 2008; Bigot, 2011; Brousseau, 2011) et cette hésitation connaît des échos en classe de français langue seconde, où le français québécois serait dévalué (Archambault et Corbeille, 1982; Calinon, 2009). Dans la présente étude, nous avons observé les attitudes linguistiques d'apprenants de français langue seconde à Montréal face à la variation sociophonétique sur le plan dialectal France/Québec, mais aussi, sur le plan stylistique propre aux situations formelles et informelles. À l'aide de la technique du locuteur masqué (Lambert et coll., 1960), nous avons fait entendre et évaluer, par 43 participants, des locuteurs de France et du Québec que nous avions au préalable enregistrés, produisant exactement le même discours dans deux situations différentes; soit, sous quatre étiquettes – inconnues des participants : Québec formel, Québec informel, France formel, France informel. Les résultats que nous avons obtenus tendent clairement à démontrer que la variation stylistique a, plus fortement que ne l'a fait la variation dialectale, polarisé les jugements de nos participants. Nouvellement par rapport à Kircher (2012), les pistes québécoises (formelles) ont souvent été évaluées au haut de l'échelle. Parallèlement, et ceci teinte le résultat précédent, ces pistes québécoises formelles ont été plus souvent identifiées au français de France qu'à celui du Québec. Cet amalgame entre langue formelle et français européen, observé également chez Calinon (2009), nous renseigne aussi sur la perception qu'ont nos participants des styles et des variétés dialectales. Le portrait que nous tirons des attitudes linguistiques des apprenants en francisation interrogés est, en définitive, nuancé et détaillé.

A range of varieties are performed on the show by a handful of actors. We analyzed several linguistic variables in the speech of three of the main characters — the 14-year-old twins Vale and Valea, and their father Pepelo. Pepelo produces high levels of the vernacular features of DH-stopping and TH-fronting, consistent with his biography as a second-language speaker whose pronunciation is influenced by his native language, Samoan. His sons, as second-generation speakers, have these features too but at lower frequencies. The twins also differ from each other, with the streetwise Valea, who is more aligned with Pasifika youth culture, producing higher levels of the variables than the studious Vale. Pepelo produces unaspirated initial /p/s, again a Pasifika language feature, while his sons do not. Linking-/r/, however, appears to index a youth identity but not adult immigrant status. We conclude that performed varieties can reflect the linguistic production of a community in their selection of specific features. The quantitative patterns can be quite variable, but here succeed in indexing salient identities for their audiences.},

	abstract = {Rule- and usage-based models in phonology are difficult to reconcile: ‘rule’-based approaches (including generative and optimality models) rely on abstraction and seek to account for regularity and generality. Usage-based models, like exemplar theory, rely on concrete representations, eschewing abstraction; they typically seek to account for lexically differentiated phonological phenomena, including variability, gradience and probabilistic properties. An alternative that incorporates both generative productivity and quantitative precision is the “variable rule” (VR) model of sociolinguistic variation. VR preserves advantages of rule-based models, including abstraction and the capacity to represent categorical processes. But VR resolves many limitations of these formalisms using probabilistic quantification: any phonological process or constraint may be associated with a probability, which permits the treatment of variation and gradience. This paper cites evidence from variation in speech style, child language, and reanalysis across the life span showing that speakers have both discrete abstract and nondiscrete, variable elements of phonology. Variable processes provide a nondeterministic but recoverable link between these different representations.},

The constraints, expressing desirable (i.e., optimal) phonological states, evaluate possible candidate forms, selecting the optimal output. Any constraint may be violated by a surface form if it is overridden by a higherranked constraint; the ordinal sequence of constraints provides a weak quantification of constraint effects. Variability has been treated within OT by varying constraint orders. This model is analogous in several important respects to the variable rule model (VR) of Labov (1969) and Cedergren and Sankoff (1974). In VR, variable constraints express desirable phonological states which are variably realized on the surface, when not overridden by other constraints; constraints are probabilistically quantified. This article compares the OT and VR models, arguing that the VR model is superior on theoretical and empirical grounds: constraint effects in VR are stable, transparent, and learnable. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of constraint effects allows VR to model successfully cases in which multiple violations of a single constraint lead to a cumulative reduction in likelihood of a form; such cases cannot be efficiently treated in OT.},

	shorttitle = {What is "{NAS}"?},
	url = {http://search.proquest.com/docview/304281956/},
	abstract = {This dissertation investigates the theoretical problems and practical considerations inherent in the definition of a dialect and a language in the South Slavic linguistic region. Specifically, it focuses upon the place of the Macedonian language in what is generally recognized as the South Slavic dialect continuum--both from the perspective of the linguist and the perspective of the speaker. A concern of this study is a reconciliation of three apparent paradoxes in previous approaches to defining a language in a continuum situation: (1) from the linguist's perspective, languages exist in a continuum, but an ethnolinguistic group has discrete boundaries from the speaker's perspective; (2) a language is defined either by formal linguistic features or by its perceived sociopolitical status; and (3) linguistic boundaries are posited either on the basis of objective features or subjective features. A sociolinguistic approach facilitates this examination of the interrelationship between a language and ethnonational identity. The notion that perception and self-ascription play a constitutive role in ethnonational identity is explored. It is proposed that a language is the objective link (i.e., as objectified by its speakers) and one of the primary means by which ethnonational identity is understood by speakers of Macedonian. Moreover, a language, especially in its standard codified form, acquires a symbolic function for its speakers; the nature of a language as a symbolic institution has specific linguistic consequences for its speakers. Data for this study derives from the results of questionnaires and interviews conducted in Macedonia during a ten month period, September 1994-July 1995. The questionnaires and interviews center upon language attitudes toward the neighboring Slavic languages and toward linguistic variation. Two results emerge from the data: (1) Macedonian speakers perceive Serbian to be closer to Macedonian than Bulgarian in spite of the linguistic historical and grammatical-structural affinities between Macedonian and Bulgarian and (2) Macedonian speakers are more likely to accept elements which overlap with Macedonian if it occurs in a Serbian context than elements which overlap with Macedonian if it occurs in a Bulgarian context. These data contribute to several conclusions regarding (1) native speaker perceptions of the place of Macedonian within the South Slavic linguistic continuum; (2) a definition of the Macedonian language for its speakers that encompasses its linguistic, sociohistoric, and symbolic dimensions; (3) and a method for determining speech markers that may characterize a speaker as Macedonian. This process of recontextualizing the problem of defining a language within a dialect continuum situation gives rise to the concept of an ethnolect. A model of an ethnolect is proposed as a means to bridge the theoretical gaps created by previous approaches to language definitions and provide insight into how linguistic boundaries are constructed for the speaker. An ethnolect, it is argued, is constituted by a set of linguistic and nonlinguistic features; these features are perceived in a hierarchical arrangement which, by its nature, constructs a boundary. A partial hierarchy of linguistic features, interpreted as speech markers of identity, is proposed for Macedonian based on questionnaire and interview responses to specific linguistic features An ethnolect, then, offers a means of correlating sociolinguistic descriptors--status, prestige, and function--with linguistic descriptors--idiolect, dialect, and grammatical category--in a way that provides a comprehensive objective framework for studying and measuring the subjective dimensions of a language in the context of ethnonational identity.},

A section in this chapter reviews some variationist studies which have employed the network concept, and begins by noting that the effect of interpersonal relationships on language choices has long been explored in sociolinguistics; witness Gauchat's account of variation in the vernacular of the Swiss village of Charmey. It discusses some of the major methods and findings of this research, before reviewing two later studies which take it as a point of departure. The chapter concludes by considering the links between mobility, social network structure, and social class.},

In keeping with current Internet research findings, players were found to use the game to extend real-life relationships, meet new people, form relationships of varying strength, and also use others merely as a backdrop. The key moderator of these outcomes appears to be the game's mechanic, which encourages some kinds of interactions while discouraging others.

Because it abstractly represents speaker interaction, this approach imposes a taxonomic distinction between stylistic and social constraints. By focussing on single variables in isolation, such accounts wrench individual variables out of the context that defines them. Recent accounts of style recognise the context-dependency of socialmeaning. We must therefore consider how a particular combination of linguistic and extralinguistic resources interact to produce an overall style that subsumes the traditional style/social constraint distinction. I explore how the styles created by a community of girls function to produce a system of distinction (Irvine 2001) in their high school, by considering how each group uses morphosyntactic and discourse-related variables to define themselves in relation to other social groups. The analysis reveals that sociolinguistic meaning is never achieved by a single group in isolation, but is the consequence of a collaborative negotiation of available resources. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater} Traditionnellement, les analyses sociolinguistiques isolent les variables individuelles et situent leur usage sur une \&\#x000E9;chelle de formalit\&\#x000E9;.

Several conclusions are noteworthy: First, and least controversially, we note that LAMSAS is dialectometrically challenging at least due to the range of field workers and questionnaires employed. Second, on the issue of which areas ought to be recognized, we note that our investigations tend to support a three-way North/South/Midlands division rather than a two-way North/South division, i.e. they tend to support Kurath and McDavid rather than Carver, but this tendency is not conclusive. Third, we extend dialectometric technique in suggesting means of dealing with alternate forms and multiple responses.},

Our perpetual connectedness gives us endless opportunities to be part of the give-and-take of networking.Some worry that this new environment makes us isolated and lonely. But in Networked, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman show how the large, loosely knit social circles of networked individuals expand opportunities for learning, problem solving, decision making, and personal interaction. The new social operating system of "networked individualism" liberates us from the restrictions of tightly knit groups; it also requires us to develop networking skills and strategies, work on maintaining ties, and balance multiple overlapping networks.Rainie and Wellman outline the "triple revolution" that has brought on this transformation: the rise of social networking, the capacity of the Internet to empower individuals, and the always-on connectivity of mobile devices. Drawing on extensive evidence, they examine how the move to networked individualism has expanded personal relationships beyond households and neighborhoods; transformed work into less hierarchical, more team-driven enterprises; encouraged individuals to create and share content; and changed the way people obtain information. Rainie and Wellman guide us through the challenges and opportunities of living in the evolving world of networked individuals.},

The initial assumption of this paper is that nominal appositions behave as nonreferring, nominal predicates. The comparison of fronted appositions and specificational sentences reveals that in both constructions, the fronted (nonreferential) phrase receives a list-reading, a type of interpretation typically associated with an event-type, stage-level predicate. It further appears that apposed nominals which include a null determiner are steadily associated with a stage-level reading, whatever their linear position with respect to their antecedent; contrastively, apposed nominals which include the overt indefinite determiner (un) are associated with an individuallevel readin. A correlate appears to exist between the type of determiner and the syntactic locus of the apposed nominal : the null determiner occurs in fronted appositions (even though these may be moved to the right), while the indefinite determiner occurs in postposed appositions. These descriptive results lead us to conclude that the null and indefinite determiners must have their own syntactic function, and more precisely, must correspond to some functional heads.},

	abstract = {The ability to process the linguistic input in real time is crucial for successfully acquiring a language, and yet little is known about how language learners comprehend or produce language in real time. Against this background, we have conducted a detailed study of grammatical processing in language learners using experimental psycholinguistic techniques and comparing different populations (mature native speakers, child first language [L1] and adult second language [L2] learners) as well as different domains of language (morphology and syntax). This article presents an overview of the results from this project and of other previous studies, with the aim of explaining how grammatical processing in language learners differs from that of mature native speakers. For child L1 processing, we will argue for a continuity hypothesis claiming that the child's parsing mechanism is basically the same as that of mature speakers and does not change over time. Instead, empirical differences between child and mature speaker's processing can be explained by other factors such as the child's limited working memory capacity and by less efficient lexical retrieval. In nonnative (adult L2) language processing, some striking differences to native speakers were observed in the domain of sentence processing. Adult learners are guided by lexical–semantic cues during parsing in the same way as native speakers, but less so by syntactic information. We suggest that the observed L1/L2 differences can be explained by assuming that the syntactic representations adult L2 learners compute during comprehension are shallower and less detailed than those of native speakers.},

Our findings show journalists engaging earlier than non- journalists in the spread and the correction of false rumors. However, compared to other users, journalists are (proportionally) more likely to deny false rumors. Journalists are also more likely to author original tweets and to be retweeted—underscoring their continued role in shaping the news. Interestingly, journalists scored high on “power user” measures, but were distinct from other power users in significant ways—e.g. by being more likely to deny rumors.},

	abstract = {This study is a response to the long-standing need -within the field of Applied Linguistics for a "better understanding of General Canadian English and for a quantitative documentation of its usage. This dissertation presents an analysis of a sample of this national language as spoken "by persons whose mother tongue is English and who were born and raised in the city of Ottawa. The analysis demonstrates that the informants vary their speech patterns according to the linguistic tasks which they are asked to perform. Further, the analysis demonstrates that variations in usage are correlated to age, sex,
And socio-economic status. 
An hour-long interview was conducted with one hundred informants by means of a questionnaire which was designed to elicit phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and lexical responses while the informants were performing a number of language related tasks. Unlike several urban socio-dialectology surveys conducted recently, this survey analyses the speech characteristics of a broad range of the socio-economic structure from skid row through the middle classes to the lower upper class. It is thereby the first such survey dealing with Worth American English which includes the mainstream of society as well as the minority ethnic groups.
Prior to presenting the extensive data and evaluative comments on the co-variation of stylistic and sociological variation of Canadian English usage, a number of background subjects are dealt with. First, a review and evaluation of previous dialectology studies is presented. Second, the background of Ottawa's settlement patterns and present situation is discussed. Third, the development of Canadian English is traced through time so that this national dialect can be placed in relation to other dialects of the English language family. This is followed by a detailed account of those characteristics which distinguish
Canadian English from Northern American, its closest relative. The fourth subject dealt with is the methodology of the study itself.
Chapter 5 presents an analysis of the co-variation of 27 phonological segments and sociological and stylistic parameters. Our data forcefully prove our hypothesis of phonological and stylistic co-variation, with 20 of the 27 items demonstrating variation directly related to the degree of formality of the task performed by the informant. Similarly, our data prove our hypothesis of phonological and socio-economic co-variation.
In this case, 10 of the 27 items demonstrate ordered stratification. The upper classes use a much broader range of styles than do the lower classes. Our analysis also reveals important findings of sex and age differentiation in addition to a number of important phonological discoveries
.
Chapter 6 analyses the co-variation of grammatical, pronunciation, and vocabulary forms and sociological factors. The data demonstrate that 13 of 15 grammatical items, 25 of 48 pronunciation items, and 2 of 8 vocabulary items have clear and ordered socio-economic stratification. Prestige and stigmatized forms were designated according to usage patterns. These data also demonstrate sex and age differentiation; our female informants maintained the strongest class hierarchy, had the lowest frequency of stigmatized forms, and the highest frequency of prestige forms. Both Chapters 5 and 6 have a summary section which contains the important findings of their respective analyses.
The Conclusion contains a summary of the significant findings and suggestions for future studies. Appendices A to G contain the questionnaire,
the complete computer printout of the data, and tabular presentations
of paralinguistic and attitudinal observations.},

schoolchildren from both sexes equally from families with
highest and lowest education. The social parameters are related
to fourteen phonological, morphological and syntactic variables.
This work is presented in five chapters.
Chapter One gives general background information on the
city of Tehran and its social structure. It also discusses the
history of the Persian language from early days and gives some
comments on the writing system.
Chapter Two is about the research in Tehran. It gives the
characteristics of the sample and the method of interview. It
also gives a short introduction on sociolinguistic variables as
well as the theoretical issues.
In Chapter Three the co-variation of the linguistic variables
and the social factors, such as class, sex and age, as well as
style, are discussed and shown by means of figures and tables.
Chapter Four is about the politeness system in Persian.
Here the pronouns and verbs and their variations are given.
The combination of these variations and their application in
terms of power and solidarity are also discussed.
Chapter Five gives an overview of the results of the analysis.
It discusses the various theoretical issues such as transition
probabilities, lexical diffusion, and the sociolinguistic
structure of Tehran in detail, and draws the final conclusion.},

In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance.

Since accommodation theory's emergence in the early l970s, it has attracted empirical attention across many disciplines and has been elaborated and expanded many times. In Contexts of Accommodation, accommodation theory is presented as a basis for sociolinguistic explanation, and it is the applied perspective that predominates this edited collection. The book seeks to demonstrate how the core concepts and relationships invoked by accommodation theory are available for addressing altogether pragmatic concerns. Accommodative processes can, for example, facilitate or impede language learners' proficiency in a second language as well as immigrants' acceptance into certain host communities; affect audience ratings and thereby the life of a television program; affect reaction to defendants in court and hence the nature of the judicial outcome; and be an enabling or detrimental force in allowing handicapped people to fulfill their communicative potential.},

These utterances cannot be accounted for in current theories of speech acts unless several basic changes are made. In our proposal, the speaker performs two types of illocutionary act with each utterance. One is the traditional kind, such as an assertion, promise, or apology; this is directed at the addressees. The other, called an informative, is directed at all the participants in the conversation-the addressees and third parties alike. It is intended to inform all of them jointly of the assertion, promise, or apology being directed at the addressees. We present evidence that every traditional illocutionary act is performed by means of an informative.},

	abstract = {Stylization is the knowing deployment of culturally familiar
styles and identities that are marked as deviating from those
predictably associated with the current speaking context. Dialect
stylization involves performing non-current-first-person personas
by phonological and related means, sometimes in play or parody.
Although these processes may seem to be very local, it is arguably
true that dialects are increasingly experienced in reflexive
and mediated environments that breed stylization. One of these
is light entertainment on radio; this article analyzes data
from English-language national radio broadcasts in Wales. Welshness
is self-consciously evoked in the data, partly through dialect
performance, where the variables (ou) and (ei) are a rich semiotic
resource, linked to nondialectal means of evoking Welsh cultural
stances and practices. Although stylization is a form of strategic
de-authentication, its ultimate relationship with authenticity
is complex. As a facet of cultural performance, stylization
can be part of a process of cultural reproduction, and I argue
that this is the best interpretation of the present data. As
a result, sociolinguistics may need to reconsider its assumptions
about cultural authenticity.},

Using tapes of daily conversations between three male-female couples as data, I present some observations on the ways conversation is controlled as well as the results of transcript analysis. The analysis describes the concrete strategies used by men and women in interaction. Women do more conversational work than men; this is the interactional manifestation of power relations. Finally, some suggestions are made on the importance of studying interactions in the areas of availability and maintenance of one's gender identity.},

	shorttitle = {Mark my words!},
	doi = {10.1145/1963405.1963509},
	abstract = {The psycholinguistic theory of communication accommodation accounts for the general observation that participants in conversations tend to converge to one another's communicative behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through small-scale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting. Furthermore, when investigating concepts such as stylistic influence and symmetry of accommodation, we discover a complexity of the phenomenon which was never observed before. We also explore the potential relation between stylistic influence and network features commonly associated with social status.},

We provide an overview of the main types of discontinuities in variable usage which have been attested both in majority and minority languages and discuss 
twelve cases of discontinuity which have been documented in the speech of Franco-Ontarian adolescents residing in minority Francophone communities. We also attempt to account for the existence of these discontinuities and consider their implications for the concept of the speech community.},

	abstract = {The racialized and exoticized cult of Voodoo occupies a central place in the popular image of the Crescent City. But as Kodi A. Roberts argues in Voodoo and Power, the religion was not a monolithic tradition handed down from African ancestors to their American-born descendants. Instead, a much more complicated patchwork of influences created New Orleans Voodoo, allowing it to move across boundaries of race, class, and gender. By employing late nineteenth and early twentieth-century first-hand accounts of Voodoo practitioners and their rituals, Roberts provides a nuanced understanding of who practiced Voodoo and why.Voodoo in New Orleans, a melange of religion, entrepreneurship, and business networks, stretched across the color line in intriguing ways. Roberts's analysis demonstrates that what united professional practitioners, or "workers," with those who sought their services was not a racially uniform folk culture, but rather the power and influence that Voodoo promised. Recognizing that social immobility proved a common barrier for their patrons, workers claimed that their rituals could overcome racial and gendered disadvantages and create new opportunities for their clients.Voodoo rituals and institutions also drew inspiration from the surrounding milieu, including the privations of the Great Depression, the city's complex racial history, and the free-market economy. Money, employment, and business became central concerns for the religion's practitioners: to validate their work, some began operating from recently organized "Spiritual Churches," entities that were tax exempt and thus legitimate in the eyes of the state of Louisiana. Practitioners even leveraged local figures like the mythohistoric Marie Laveau for spiritual purposes and entrepreneurial gain. All the while, they contributed to the cultural legacy that fueled New Orleans's tourist industry and drew visitors and their money to the Crescent City.},

This article seeks to fill these lacunae and explores the Yorùbá influences on these two neo-African religious traditions both from a contemporary and historical perspective, sorting through many misconceptions attached to the confusing and, for the most part, derogatory English term Voodoo. Interestingly, it is the powerful warrior spirits Eshu/Elegba and Ogun who proved to be the most resilient survivors of Yorùbá cosmology in the Haitian and New Orleanian diaspora.},

Fieldork in non-metropolitan Mexico demonstrates the utility of our model, which can be applied across both urban and non-urban domains. It is compatible with the Milroys' central mechanism for the description of individual speech usage and group cohesion or susceptibility to change in terms of the social network. Based on linguistic variable types, this model has a hierarchy of four nested fields (speech community configurations) into which each individual is placed, according to his/her demonstrated recognition of the social evaluation associated with the variables. At the most local configuration, speakers demonstrate no knowledge of generally stigmatized variables; in the second, speakers register an awareness of stigmatized variables; in the third, an awareness of stigmatized and regional variables; and in the fourth, speakers model standard variants over regional ones. This model classifies the kinds of sociolinguistic variables that are pertinent in this social setting and also provides a structured manner for dealing with dialect contact dynamics.

An international team of fourteen specialists offer a wide-ranging analysis, from theoretical discussions of the origin of dialects, to detailed descriptions of the history of individual Standard English features. The volume ranges from Middle English to the present day, and looks at a variety of text types. It concludes that Standard English had no one single ancestor dialect, but is the cumulative result of generations of authoritative writing from many text types.},

	abstract = {When natural language input contains grammatical forms that are used probabilistically and inconsistently, learners will sometimes reproduce the inconsistencies; but sometimes they will instead regularize the use of these forms, introducing consistency in the language that was not present in the input. In this paper we ask what produces such regularization. We conducted three artificial language experiments, varying the use of determiners in the types of inconsistency with which they are used, and also comparing adult and child learners. In Experiment 1 we presented adult learners with scattered inconsistency – the use of multiple determiners varying in frequency in the same context – and found that adults will reproduce these inconsistencies at low levels of scatter, but at very high levels of scatter will regularize the determiner system, producing the most frequent determiner form almost all the time. In Experiment 2 we showed that this is not merely the result of frequency: when determiners are used with low frequencies but in consistent contexts, adults will learn all of the determiners veridically. In Experiment 3 we compared adult and child learners, finding that children will almost always regularize inconsistent forms, whereas adult learners will only regularize the most complex inconsistencies. Taken together, these results suggest that regularization processes in natural language learning, such as those seen in the acquisition of language from non-native speakers or in the formation of young languages, may depend crucially on the nature of language learning by young children.},

French in Louisiana has been spoken for hundreds of years, and, in spite of the decline of first-language speakers of the local Louisiana variety, contemporary efforts to promote and preserve the language have developed and expanded since the 1960’s. This historically disenfranchised language and culture strives to exist into the future through a variety of methods including immersion education, formal and informal community organization and growing interest in Louisiana’s heritage as a Francophone region. Through literature review and the collection of qualitative data, the author explores the current diversity of efforts to promote French in Louisiana and analyzes the causes and conditions of the language’s presence as of 2015. The findings suggest declining numbers of first-language speakers of the Louisiana variety but a possibility for a more significant presence of French language associated with Louisiana culture through the efforts analyzed.},

	abstract = {The time has now come when graph theory should be part of the education of every serious student of mathematics and computer science, both for its own sake and to enhance the appreciation of mathematics as a whole. This book is an in-depth account of graph theory, written with such a student in mind; it reflects the current state of the subject and emphasizes connections with other branches of pure mathematics. The volume grew out of the author's earlier book, Graph Theory -- An Introductory Course, but its length is well over twice that of its predecessor, allowing it to reveal many exciting new developments in the subject. Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses competing for the attention of a student, the book contains extensive descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the subject and to arouse interest. In addition to a modern treatment of the classical areas of graph theory such as coloring, matching, extremal theory, and algebraic graph theory, the book presents a detailed account of newer topics, including Szemer'edi's Regularity Lemma and its use, Shelah's extension of the Hales-Jewett Theorem, the precise nature of the phase transition in a random graph process, the connection between electrical networks and random walks on graphs, and the Tutte polynomial and its cousins in knot theory. In no other branch of mathematics is it as vital to tackle and solve challenging exercises in order to master the subject. To this end, the book contains an unusually large number of well thought-out exercises: over 600 in total. Although some are straightforward, most of them are substantial, and others will stretch even the most able reader.},

The book has chapters on electrical networks, flows, connectivity and matchings, extremal problems, colouring, Ramsey theory, random graphs, and graphs and groups. Each chapter starts at a measured and gentle pace. Classical results are proved and new insight is provided, with the examples at the end of each chapter fully supplementing the text... Even so this allows an introduction not only to some of the deeper results but, more vitally, provides outlines of, and firm insights into, their proofs. Thus in an elementary text book, we gain an overall understanding of well-known standard results, and yet at the same time constant hints of, and guidelines into, the higher levels of the subject. It is this aspect of the book which should guarantee it a permanent place in the literature." \#Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society\#1},

Nos résultats nous permettent de répondre par l'affirmative pour la première question, mais nous hésitons à affirmer de fortes conclusions pour la dernière question en raison d'un manque de données.

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Studies of Louisiana French, a language long spoken by people in Louisiana, almost unanimously lament the inevitable death of the language, yet very little
information exists on the strengths and weaknesses of the language in various media. These predictions are generally based only on the change in the number of speakers over
time obtained through census data (Bankston and Henry 1998; Henry 1997:186-187),
which is notoriously unreliable (Blyth 1997:28-29; Dubois 1997:47; Brown 1997:224).
Census data does not differentiate who in the house is speaking French nor to what extent
they speak French. The questions on the census are not necessarily consistent over time
nor entirely clear in a linguistic climate where the terms French, Cajun French, Louisiana
French, and Creole, may all mean different things to different people.

This thesis took a different approach by measuring the strength of Louisiana
French via its use in Cajun music. The language is used in the music often but its overall importance in defining the music, the fluency of the singers, and the form it takes—be it
clearly Louisiana French or a mixture of Standard French as well—have not been thoroughly analyzed before. Two conclusions were arrived at: Louisiana French is an integral aspect of Cajun music and the French being used is highly marked as being
Louisiana French. The music itself was defined using a method inspired by optimality theory, allowing the importance of French in the music to be compared to various other
musical and extramusical features. The quality of the language used in each recording was then examined to determine how native-like it was.},

Structurally, this new model extends the old one by adding phonological and semantic lexical representations to the available orthographic ones, and assigns a different role to the so-called language nodes. Furthermore, it makes a distinction between the effects of non-linguistic context (such as instruction and stimulus list composition) and linguistic context (such as the semantic and syntactic effects of sentence context), based on a distinction between the word identification system itself and a task/decision system that regulates control. At the end of the paper, the generalizability of the BIA+ model to different tasks and modalities is discussed.},

	abstract = {We argue that mutual intelligibility testing is an adequate way to determine how different two languages or language varieties are. We tested the mutual intelligibility of 15 Chinese dialects functionally at the level of isolated words (word-intelligibility) and the level of sentences (sentence intelligibility). We collected data for each dialect by playing isolated words and sentences spoken in 15 Chinese dialects to 15 listeners. Word-intelligibility was determined by having listeners perform a semantic categorization task whereby words had to be classified as one of ten different categories such as body part, plant, animal, etc. Sentence intelligibility was estimated by having the listeners translate a target word in each sentence into their own dialect. We obtained 47,250 data (15×150×15 for the word part and 15×60×15 for the sentence part). We also had at our disposal structural similarity measures (lexical similarity, phonological correspondence) for each pair of the 15 Chinese dialects published by Cheng (Computational Linguistics \& Chinese Language Processing 1997, 2.1, pp. 41–72). Our general conclusion is that the degree of mutual intelligibility can be determined by both opinion and functional tests. These two subjective measures are significantly correlated with one another and can be predicted from objective measures (lexical similarity and phonological correspondence) equally well. However, functional intelligibility measures, especially at the sentence level, better reflect Chinese dialect classifications than opinion scores.},

	abstract = {We report two experiments that investigate the effects of sentence context on bilingual lexical access in Spanish and English. Highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences in Spanish and English that included a marked word to be named. The word was either a cognate with similar orthography and/or phonology in the two languages, or a matched non-cognate control. Sentences appeared in one language alone (i.e., Spanish or English) and target words were not predictable on the basis of the preceding semantic context. In Experiment 1, we mixed the language of the sentence within a block such that sentences appeared in an alternating run in Spanish or in English. These conditions partly resemble normally occurring inter-sentential code-switching. In these mixed language sequences, cognates were named faster than non-cognates in both languages. There were no effects of switching the language of the sentence. In Experiment 2, with Spanish-English bilinguals matched closely to those who participated in the first experiment, we blocked the language of the sentences to encourage language-specific processes. The results were virtually identical to those of the mixed language experiment. In both cases, target cognates were named faster than non-cognates, and the magnitude of the effect did not change according to the broader context. Taken together, the results support the predictions of the Bilingual Interactive Activation + Model (Dijkstra \&amp; Van Heuven, 2002) in demonstrating that bilingual lexical access is language nonselective even under conditions in which language-specific cues should enable selective processing. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to lexical switching from one language to the other, inter-sentential code-switching of the sort in which bilinguals frequently engage, imposes no significant costs to lexical processing.},

	abstract = {Southern Louisiana is the only effective remnant of the French presence in the Mississippi River valley during the 18th century. During the colonial period, settled French Louisiana was a small neglected parcel of the vast French North American empire. Later, under the Spanish, it was seen as little more than a shield for New Spain against Anglo-American encroachement.
Despite political Americanization in the early 19th century, rural French Louisiana continued to grow as a distinctively French region. In response to Anglo penetration, new environments were occupied and mastered. By 1900, southern Louisiana was a lively and discrete culture region within the United States. It was, however, compartmentalized, reflecting ethnic diversity within the French population, diversity in physical geography, and class-based social differentiation. A Louisiana-wide French consciousness had not been achieved.
The 20th century brought better roads, radio, war, television, industrialization, and more Anglos, leading to rapid cultural change. Field work done in 1981 and 1982 examined changes in French Louisiana culture in light of three major traditional markers: Catholic religion, French language and food. It monitored the changing geography of the region in terms of boundaries, internal cultural change, and identity. The work attempts to establish whether these changes suggest continuity, extinction, or some new form of ethnicity.
Analysis reveals that geographically, French Louisiana has begun to shrink. Areas within the region have been changing at different rates, however. The French language is still being eroded despite efforts at revival. Religious indifference persists; the Catholic Church does not function as an ethnic institution. The food, however, remained very popular and has become the unifying element of the culture region.
French Louisiana now uses ethnic politics and outside approval of ethnicity to maintain itself: it has a state-recognized "official territory" and a cultural capital, Lafayette. The Cajun identity has been beautified and promoted as the new regional identity (but excludes the non-white French population). The food, a national fad, has replaced language as the most important element of the French Louisiana culture. These changes suggest that traditional French Louisiana is entering the American cultural mainstream.},

	abstract = {If I Could Turn My Tongue Like That, by Thomas Klingler, is an in-depth study of the Creole language spoken in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, a community situated on the west bank of the Mississippi River above Baton Rouge that dates back to the early eighteenth century. The first comprehensive grammatical description of this particular variety of Louisiana Creole, Klingler's work is timely indeed, since most Creole speakers in the Pointe Coupee area are over sixty-five and the language is not being passed on to younger generations. It preserves and explains an important yet little understood part of America's cultural heritage that is rapidly disappearing.The heart of the book is a detailed morphosyntactic description based on some 150 hours of interviews with Pointe Coupee Creole speakers. Each grammatical feature is amply illustrated with contextual examples, and Klingler's descriptive framework will facilitate comparative research. The author also provides historical and sociolinguistic background information on the region, examining economic, demographic, and social conditions that contributed to the formation and spread of Creole in Louisiana. Pointe Coupee Creole is unusual, and in some cases unique, because of such factors as the parish's early exposure to English, its rapid development of a plantation economy, and its relative insulation from Cajun French.The volume concludes with transcriptions and English translations of Creole folk tales and of Klingler's conversations with Pointe Coupee's residents, a treasure trove of cultural and linguistic raw data. This kind of rarely printed material will be essential in preserving Creole in the future. Encylopedic in its approach and featuring a comprehensive bibliography, If I Could Turn My Tongue Like That is a rich resource for those interested in the development of Louisiana Creole and in Francophony.},

The goal of this paper is to determine the origins \& the directions of language change within the system of locative prepositions. The majority of the interviews are taken from the Cajun French/English corpus, conducted by Dubois in 1997. Our results indicate that the restricted speakers use an array of innovative forms in all locative categories. Systemic \& extralinguistic evidence show that some of these forms represent interference-induced innovations, while others are internally-motivated innovations stimulated in an indirect way by language contact. A model of change emerges where the older restricted speakers introduce changes that are gradually adopted by the following generations, regardless of the extent to which their linguistic ability in Cajun French is diminished. 5 Tables, 1 Figure, 18 References.

In this study, I examine rates of r-lessness in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which caused large-scale displacement in the region. Participants come from the linguistically conservative suburb of Chalmette, where r-lessness is more robust than in New Orleans proper. Participants’ connections to Chalmette were measured in two ways: (1) post-Katrina location status, i.e. whether participants returned or relocated after the storm; (2) place orientation, captured via an ethnographically informed, multifaceted measure of stance and exposure to places outside of Chalmette. Analysis revealed that place orientation better predicts rates of r-lessness than post-Katrina location. I argue that the marked quality of r-lessness makes it available for identity-driven use to express a connection to Chalmette. This study demonstrates one way to account for the linguistic implications of individuals’ shifting allegiances to places they live(d).},

This study oﬀers several options regarding New Orleans accents to actors, dialect teachers, directors, designers, and coaches for class, stage, or ﬁlm productions. As a port city on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast, New Orleans accents share characteristics with many other Southern accents, such as substituting /d/ for /ð/, dropping “g” from “-ing” gerunds, and adding “a-” before a verb, but there are identiﬁable diﬀerences within the city’s accents. To examine diﬀerences among some New Orleans accents, the Yat and Uptown accents from Alvarez and Kolker’s 1985 ﬁlm Yeah You Rite! were compared with a Cajun French accent and portrayals of the Yat accent in New Orleans comics and newspapers. This study’s transcriptions of New Orleans speakers from diﬀerent neighborhoods document variation in the production of vowels, consonants, and rhoticity. Diﬀerences among the three studied accents were noted. However, inconsistences in vowels, consonants, and rhoticity within neighborhoods, and within the same individual’s speech, were observed more frequently than expected. Given that accents reﬂect character and culture, this examination of some characteristics of Yat, Uptown, and Cajun French accents presents options for increased nuance in the representation of New Orleans characters.},

The children were faster to orient to the referent on different-gender trials, when the article was potentially informative, than on same-gender trials, when it was not, and this ability was correlated with productive measures of lexical and grammatical competence. Spanish-learning children who can speak only 500 words already use gender-marked articles in establishing reference, a processing advantage characteristic of native Spanish-speaking adults.},

	abstract = {This study documents variation in the French of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes, Louisiana, seeking possible correspondence between language variation and ethnicity or geographic origin of the speaker. In doing so the study seeks to document the French of a long-neglected Francophone community, the American Indians of South Louisiana. Both general and scholarly presentations of francophone Louisiana have tended to stress the Acadian ancestry of Louisiana French, thereby misrepresenting the complexity of Louisiana's linguistic and ethnic makeup. Native American francophones have been particularly neglected by researchers, under the assumption, untested, that they have fully assimilated to their white (Cajun) neighbours, including the adoption a French identical to theirs in the 19th century as a result of extensive contact and intermarriage.
The study is based on extensive ethnolinguistic fieldwork conducted over a nearly three-year period from January of 2006 until the fall of 2008. Data were collected in two parts. The first was an extensive sociolinguistic interview, comprising a translation exercise and a long sociolinguistic questionnaire that collected a sample of casual speech in addition to demographic information. The second was a perception exercise in which informants were asked to listen to sound clips and guess the ethnic and regional affiliation of the speaker. Both these elements were buttressed by extensive participant observation.
The results reveal a complex interplay between ethnic and geographic variation in the region. While no features emerged that were unique to Louisiana (whether to Indians or Cajuns), a general pattern exists that distinguishes Indians from Cajuns and links the Indian communities to each other. Moreover, there is additional variation within both the Indian and Cajun communities, with Indians attesting more internal variation than Cajuns and each Indian community distinguishing itself in some way—if not several ways—from the others. The town of Dulac/Grand Caillou further emerged as the source of many of the Indian patterns of speech. Finally, the perception test revealed a tendency within the area to minimize the importance of recognized variation, and moreover revealed a possible lowering of long-held barriers between ethnic groups in the region.},

Between-language lexical competitors had a phoneme onset in Spanish that was shared with the target (‘ bi gote’, ‘mustache’ in English). Participant groups varied in their age-of-acquisition of English and Spanish, and were examined in one of three language modes (Grosjean, 1998, 2001). A strong within-language (English) lexical competition (or cohort effect) was modulated by language mode and age of second language acquisition. A weaker between-language (Spanish) cohort effect was influenced primarily by the age-of-acquisition of Spanish. These results highlight the role of age-of-acquisition and mode in language processing. They are discussed in comparison to previous studies addressing the role of these two variables and in terms of existing models of bilingual word recognition.},

	abstract = {Evidence suggests that speakers hyperarticulate phonetic cues to word identity in a way that increases phonetic distance to similar competitors. However, the degree and type of phonetic similarity between competitors which induces hyperarticulation remains unclear. Here, we compared neighborhood density (as a representative of a phonetically-general type of similarity) to the existence of a phonetic cue-specific lexical minimal pair in terms of their ability to predict hyperarticulation of two different cue-types in a corpus of natural English speech. For all phonetic cues that we investigated – word-initial voiceless stop VOT, word-initial voiced stop VOT, and vowel-vowel Euclidean formant distance – cue-specific minimal pair existence significantly predicted cue hyperarticulation, while neighborhood density did not. Further, the direction of change in a phonetic cue was found not to be consistent within a given cue-type, but instead varied as a function of the phonetic relationship, creating greater phonetic distance to the competitor. For tokens of word-initial voiceless stops, existence of a voiced-stop minimal pair predicted significantly longer VOT, while for word-initial voiced stops, existence of a voiceless-stop minimal pair predicted a shorter VOT. For tokens of vowels, existence of a minimal pair defined by a nearby vowel predicted greater Euclidean distance in formant space from that vowel, rather than greater expansion of the vowel space per se. For example, lax vowels in words with a more peripheral vowel minimal pair competitor (e.g., ship ∼ sheep) were relatively centralized, while tense vowels in words with a more interior vowel minimal pair competitor (e.g., date ∼ debt) were relatively peripheralized.},

Transcriber was designed for the manual segmentation and transcription of long duration broadcast news recordings, including annotation of speech turns, topics and acoustic conditions. It is highly portable, relying on the scripting language Tcl/Tk with extensions such as Snack for advanced audio functions and tcLex for lexical analysis, and has been tested on various Unix systems and Windows. The data format follows the XML standard with Unicode support for multilingual transcriptions. Distributed as free software in order to encourage the production of corpora, ease their sharing, increase user feedback and motivate software contributions, Transcriber has been in use for over a year in several countries. As a result of this collective experience, new requirements arose to support additional data formats, video control, and a better management of conversational speech. Using the annotation graphs framework recently formalized, adaptation of the tool towards new tasks and support of different data formats will become easier.
Résumé
Nous présentons “Transcriber”, un outil d'aide à la création de corpus de parole, et nous décrivons des éléments de son développement et de son utilisation. Transcriber a été conçu pour permettre la segmentation manuelle et la transcription d'enregistrements de nouvelles radio-diffusées de longue durée, ainsi que l'annotation des tours de parole, des thèmes et des conditions acoustiques. Cet outil très portable, reposant sur le langage de script Tcl/Tk et des extensions telles que Snack pour les fonctionnalités audio et tcLex pour l'analyse lexicale, a été testé sur différents systèmes Unix et sous Windows. Le format de données respecte le standard XML avec un support d'Unicode pour les transcriptions multilingues. Distribué sous license libre pour encourager la production de corpus, faciliter leur échange, augmenter le retour d'expérience des utilisateurs et motiver les contributions logicielles extérieures, Transcriber est utilisé depuis plus d'un an dans plusieurs pays. Suite à cette utilisation, de nouveaux besoins sont apparus comme le support de formats de données supplémentaires, de la vidéo, et un meilleur traitement de la parole conversationnelle. En utilisant le modèle des graphes d'annotation formalisé récemment, l'adaptation de l'outil vers de nouvelles tâches et le support de différents formats de données sera facilité.},

The circumstances of a recording are known to affect formant tracking and may therefore compromise the validity of conclusions about sound changes made on the basis of real-time data. In this paper, a traditional F1/F2-analysis using linear predictive coding (LPC) was applied to the vowels /i u a/ extracted from spontaneous speech corpora of Glaswegian vernacular, that were recorded in the 1970s and 2000s. We assessed the technical quality of each recording, concentrating on the average levels of noise and the properties of spectral balance, and showed that the corpus comprised of mixed quality data. A series of acoustic vowel analyses subsequently unveiled that formant measurements using LPC were sensitive to the technical specification of a recording, with variable magnitudes of the effects for vowels of different qualities. We evaluated the performance of three commonly used formant normalisation procedures (Lobanov, Nearey and Watt-Fabricius) as well as normalisations by a distance ratio metric and statistical estimation, and compared these results to raw Bark-scaled formant data, showing that some of the approaches could ameliorate the impact of technical issues better than the others. We discuss the implications of these results for sociophonetic research that aims to minimise extraneous influences on recorded speech data while unveiling gradual, potentially small-scale sound changes across decades.},

Dining Services decided on this name during the development of the dining hall on UGA’s Health Sciences Campus which focused on serving residents, students, and faculty/staff of that campus. Since that dining hall is smaller and a bit more unique than what is found on main campus, the department wanted students to feel as though they had found a special place or a place where they felt comfortable on campus. The Niche is a bit set apart from UGA’s other dining halls. When the Niche originally opened, it had a very specialized menu. It served grill, market, pizza, and gelato options that were not offered at the other dining halls. The department chose this name, therefore, to also reflect the location’s specialized menu and atmosphere.
 
Let me know if you have any more questions.

Evidence is now mounting that orthographic effects on loanword adaptation may be more prevalent than was once thought (cf. Paradis and LaCharité, 2002, Vendelin and Peperkamp, 2006), partially obscuring phonological effects. This paper investigates orthographic effects in the adaptation of vowels of English words loaned into Korean. Experiment I uses information-theoretic statistics, called the orthographic and perceptual information gains, to estimate a lower bound on the contribution of orthography and perception to vowel adaptation. The results suggest that orthography contributes more to the adaptation of unstressed vowels, while perception contributes more to the adaptation of stressed vowels. Experiment II considers the adaptation of the /ɛ/∼/æ/ contrast; these vowels have merged recently in Korean although the orthographic distinction is maintained. The paper concludes by proposing the Perceptual Uncertainty Hypothesis: source-loan orthographic alignment plays the greatest role in constraining loanword adaptation when phonological parsing in the borrowing language is underdetermined by perceptual factors alone.},

In half of the experiment, the stimuli are presented orally only, whereas in the other half, the oral stimuli are accompanied by their written representation. The adaptations of eight English vowels are shown to be different according to whether the input is oral or mixed (i.e. oral+written). In particular, the adaptations based on the mixed input more often reflect the way French speakers are used to read English graphemes. These results thus confirm the sensitivity of loanword adaptations to the presence versus absence of a written representation.

	abstract = {Previous research into student teachers’ knowledge about language concluded that overall the picture was fairly bleak. Such research focused on the knowledge about language that the student teachers possessed when they moved from secondary school education into Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. However, few studies have investigated the impact of the increasing demands on teachers, made in curricular documents throughout the last 20 years, to improve students’ abilities in language and whether student teachers’ knowledge about language had improved as a result of these curricular imperatives. This article reports on research into perceived and actual levels of knowledge about language conducted in a university in Scotland with students training to be primary teachers and secondary English and modern language teachers. Findings reveal that student teachers’ levels of linguistic knowledge, as measured by the instrument employed in this study, are generally low contrasting with their own more positive perceptions of their competence.},

If monophthongization is the trigger for the Southern Shift (Labov, 2010) and chain shifts operate as predicted by a modular feedforward phonological theory (cf. Bermúdez-Otero, 2007), this implies price and prize must be two ends of a phonetic continuum, rather than two discrete allophones. We test this hypothesis via distributional analysis of offglide targets and statistical analysis of the effect of vowel duration. As predicted, we find price and prize share a continuous distribution in the Inland South, the region where the Southern Shift probably originated (Labov, Ash, \& Boberg, 2006). We use Raleigh, North Carolina, outside the Inland South, as a comparison point; there, the same methodologies indicate price and prize are more discretely separated. Our results thus offer empirical support for the phonological theory that motivated the hypothesis.},

	abstract = {This volume presents a selection of the best papers from the 21st Annual University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Linguistics Symposium. Researchers from linguistics, psychology, computer science, and philosophy, using many different methods and focusing on many different facts of language, addressed the question of the existence of linguistic rules. Are such rules best seen as convenient tools for the description of languages, or are rules actually invoked by individual language users? Perhaps the most serious challenge to date to the linguistic rule is the development of connectionist architecture. Indeed, these systems must be viewed as a serious challenge to the foundations of all of contemporary linguistics. Four broad themes emerged from the Milwaukee conference, corresponding to the four parts of the volume. Part I centers on arguments for the existence of symbolic rules in linguistic competence and performance. Part II contains arguments against symbolic rules, presenting connectionist models and other alternatives to the symbolic paradigm. Parts III and IV take up two issues that are central to a number of language researchers: Language acquisition and learnability, and modularity. These issues are addressed from within both rule-based and non-rule-based perspectives.

Data were drawn from analysis of taped sessions with K-12 children from over 30 schools, interviews with 225 teachers in predominantly French-speaking communities, and analysis of works by Cajun authors, including dialect writings, humorous anecdotes, newspaper articles, local dictionaries, fiction, and folklore. The information is presented in the form of charts and outlines, without narrative. Specific  phonological features are listed with phonetic transcription and forms in standard and Cajun English are contrasted. Grammatical features for various form classes are listed, again with standard and Cajun forms contrasted. Lexical features of Cajun are listed in four categories: common expressions; widely-used French expressions; favorite foods; and miscellaneous items. (MSE)},

Recently, an extreme form of multiple activation was observed: Bilingual listeners activated words from both languages that were consistent with the input. We explored the degree to which bilingual multiple activation may be constrained by fine-grained acoustic-phonetic information. In a head-mounted eyetracking experiment, we presented Spanish-English bilinguals with spoken Spanish words having word-initial stop consonants with either English- or Spanish-appropriate voice onset times. Participants fixated interlingual distractors (nontarget pictures whose English names shared a phonological similarity with the Spanish targets) more frequently than control distractors when the target words contained English-appropriate voice onset times. These results demonstrate that fine-grained acoustic-phonetic information and a precise match between input and representation are critical for parallel activation of two languages.},

Results revealed that both bilinguals and monolinguals experienced competition from English lexical items overlapping phonetically with an English target item (e.g., spear and speaker). However, only bilingual speakers experienced competition from Russian competitor items overlapping crosslinguistically with an English target (e.g., spear and spichki, Russian for matches). English monolinguals treated the Russian competitors as they did any other filler items. This difference in performance between bilinguals and monolinguals tested with exactly the same sets of stimuli suggests that eye movements to a crosslinguistic competitor are due to activation of the other language and to between-language competition rather than being an artifact of stimulus selection or experimental design.},

	abstract = {We describe a model called the TRACE model of speech perception. The model is based on the principles of interactive activation. Information processing takes place through the excitatory and inhibitory interactions of a large number of simple processing units, each working continuously to update its own activation on the basis of the activations of other units to which it is connected. The model is called the TRACE model because the network of units forms a dynamic processing structure called “the Trace,” which serves at once as the perceptual processing mechanism and as the system's working memory. The model is instantiated in two simulation programs. TRACE I, described in detail elsewhere, deals with short segments of real speech, and suggests a mechanism for coping with the fact that the cues to the identity of phonemes vary as a function of context. TRACE II, the focus of this article, simulates a large number of empirical findings on the perception of phonemes and words and on the interactions of phoneme and word perception. At the phoneme level, TRACE II simulates the influence of lexical information on the identification of phonemes and accounts for the fact that lexical effects are found under certain conditions but not others. The model also shows how knowledge of phonological constraints can be embodied in particular lexical items but can still be used to influence processing of novel, nonword utterances. The model also exhibits categorical perception and the ability to trade cues off against each other in phoneme identification. At the word level, the model captures the major positive feature of Marslen-Wilson's COHORT model of speech perception, in that it shows immediate sensitivity to information favoring one word or set of words over others. At the same time, it overcomes a difficulty with the COHORT model: it can recover from underspecification or mispronunciation of a word's beginning. TRACE II also uses lexical information to segment a stream of speech into a sequence of words and to find word beginnings and endings, and it simulates a number of recent findings related to these points. The TRACE model has some limitations, but we believe it is a step toward a psychologically and computationally adequate model of the process of speech perception.},

The distractor objects included a cohort competitor with a name that began with the same onset and vowel as the name of the target object (e.g.,beetle), a rhyme competitor (e.g.speaker), and an unrelated competitor (e.g.,carriage). In Experiment 1, there was clear evidence for both cohort and rhyme activation as predicted by continuous mapping models such as TRACE (McClelland and Elman, 1986) and Shortlist (Norris, 1994). Additionally, the time course and probabilities of eye movements closely corresponded to response probabilities derived from TRACE simulations using the Luce choice rule (Luce, 1959). In the gating task, which emphasizes word-initial information, there was clear evidence for multiple activation of cohort members, as measured by judgments and eye movements, but no suggestion of rhyme effects. Given that the same sets of pictures were present during the gating task as in Experiment 1, we conclude that the rhyme effects in Experiment 1 were not an artifact of using a small set of visible alternatives.},

A series of three eyetracking studies suggested that, at early stages of word recognition, bilinguals can activate both languages in parallel, even when direct linguistic input is in one language only. A functional neuroimaging study suggested that, although the same general structures are active for both languages, differences within these general structures are present across languages and across levels of processing. For example, different centers of activation were associated with first versus second language processing within the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, but not within the Superior Temporal Gyrus. We suggest that parallel activation (as found with eyetracking) and shared cortical structures (as found with fMRI) may be characteristic of early stages of language processing (such as phonetic processing), but the two languages may be using separate structures at later stages of processing (such as lexical processing).},

Results support previous findings of parallel activation of lexical items within and between languages, but suggest that the magnitude of the between-language competition effect may vary across first and second languages and may be mediated by a number of factors such as stimuli, language background, and language mode.},

	abstract = {Bilingualism provides a unique opportunity for exploring hypotheses about how the human brain encodes language. For example, the “input switch” theory states that bilinguals can deactivate one language module while using the other. A new measure of spoken language comprehension, headband-mounted eyetracking, allows a firm test of this theory. When given spoken instructions to pick up an object, in a monolingual session, late bilinguals looked briefly at a distractor object whose name in the irrelevant language was initially phonetically similar to the spoken word more often than they looked at a control distractor object. This result indicates some overlap between the two languages in bilinguals, and provides support for parallel, interactive accounts of spoken word recognition in general.},

	abstract = {Bilinguals, i.e. those who use two languages in their everyday lives, move in and out of various speech modes when speaking to different interlocutors. When conversing with monolinguals, they speak one language and reduce the activation level of the other language, but when conversing with other bilinguals they choose a base language of interaction and often bring in the other language by either code-switching or borrowing. The aim of the present study is to explore how “guest words” (code-switches and borrowings) are processed by bilingual listeners when interacting with other bilinguals. Different types of English words (varying in phonotactic configuration and lexicon membership) were embedded in French sentences and were produced either as code-switches or borrowings. The gating paradigm (Grosjean, 1980) was used to present these words to French-English bilingual listeners so as to determine the role played by word type and language phonetics in the lexical access of guest words, as well as to uncover the underlying operations involved in the recognition process. Results showed that the phonotactics of a guest word, the presence or absence of a base language homophone, the language phonetics of the word, as well as the language that precedes the word, all play a role in the recognition process. An interactive activation view of bilingual word recognition is proposed to account for the results found in the study.},

	abstract = {The precision of an eye-tracker is critical to the correct identification of eye movements and their properties. To measure a system’s precision, artificial eyes (AEs) are often used, to exclude eye movements influencing the measurements. A possible issue, however, is that it is virtually impossible to construct AEs with sufficient complexity to fully represent the human eye. To examine the consequences of this limitation, we tested currently used AEs from three manufacturers of eye-trackers and compared them to a more complex model, using 12 commercial eye-trackers. Because precision can be measured in various ways, we compared different metrics in the spatial domain and analyzed the power-spectral densities in the frequency domain. To assess how precision measurements compare in artificial and human eyes, we also measured precision using human recordings on the same eye-trackers. Our results show that the modified eye model presented can cope with all eye-trackers tested and acts as a promising candidate for further development of a set of AEs with varying pupil size and pupil–iris contrast. The spectral analysis of both the AE and human data revealed that human eye data have different frequencies that likely reflect the physiological characteristics of human eye movements. We also report the effects of sample selection methods for precision calculations. This study is part of the EMRA/COGAIN Eye Data Quality Standardization Project.},

In Experiment 1, we used longer text exchanges that were more naturalistic and replicated this finding. In Experiments 2 and 3, negative responses (e.g., nope) and ambiguous responses (e.g., maybe) were also perceived as more negative, or less enthusiastic, with a period. The period can serve a rhetorical, rather than a grammatical, function in text messages. More generally, textisms such as punctuation can convey the types of social and pragmatic information that are communicated with extra-linguistic cues in face-to-face conversations.},

	abstract = {Psycholinguistics—the field of science that examines the mental processes and knowledge structures involved in the acquisition, comprehension, and production of language—had a strong monolingual orientation during (he first four decades following its emergence around 1950. The awareness that a large part of mankind speaks more than one language—that this may impact both on the way each individual language is used and on the thought processes of bilinguals and multilinguals, and that, consequently, our theories on human linguistic ability and its role in non-linguistic cognition are incomplete and, perhaps, false—has led to a steep growth of studies on bilingualism and multilingualism since around 1995. This textbook introduces the reader to the field of study that examines language acquisition, comprehension and production from the perspective of the bilingual and multilingual speaker. It furthermore provides an introduction to studies that investigate the implications of being bilingual for various aspects of non-linguistic cognition. The major topics covered are the development of language in children growing up in a bilingual environment either from birth or relatively soon after, late foreign language learning, and word recognition, sentence comprehension, speech production, and translation processes in bilinguals. Furthermore, the ability of bilinguals and multilinguals to generally produce language in the 'intended' language is discussed, as is the cognitive machinery that enables this. Finally, the consequences of bilingualism and multilingualism for non-linguistic cognition and findings and views regarding the biological basis of bilingualism and multilingualism are presented. The textbook's primary readership are students and researchers in Cognitive Psychology, Linguistics, and Applied Linguistics, but teachers of language and translators and interpreters who wish to become better informed on the cognitive and biological basis of bilingualism and multilingualism will also benefit from it.

However, much of this research is based on the comprehension of words in isolation. The authors investigated whether nonselective access occurs for words embedded in biased sentence contexts (e.g., A. I. Schwartz \& J. F. Kroll, 2006). Eye movements were recorded as French–English bilinguals read English sentences containing cognates (e.g., piano), interlingual homographs (e.g., coin, meaning corner in French), or matched control words. Sentences provided a low or high semantic constraint for target-language meanings. Both early-stage comprehension measures (e.g., first fixation duration, gaze duration, and skipping) and late-stage comprehension measures (e.g., go-past time and total reading time) showed significant cognate facilitation and interlingual homograph interference for low-constraint sentences. For high-constraint sentences, however, only early-stage comprehension measures were consistent with nonselective access. There was no evidence of cognate facilitation or interlingual homograph interference for late-stage comprehension measures. Thus, nonselective bilingual lexical access at early stages of comprehension is rapidly resolved in semantically biased contexts at later stages of comprehension.

Lexical status was manipulated by presenting target words that either overlapped in form across translation equivalents (cognate words) or did not overlap in form across translation equivalents (English-specific words). Participants identified targets (such as hen) from picture-displays that also included similar-sounding German competitor words (such as Hemd, “shirt”). Eye-movements to German competitors were used to index co-activation of German. Results showed that both bilingual groups co-activated German while processing cognate targets; however, only German-native bilinguals co-activated German while processing English-specific targets.

We thus investigated whether individual differences among bilinguals in domain-general executive control modulate cross-language activation during L2 sentence reading, over and above other factors such as L2 proficiency. Fifty French–English bilinguals read L2-English sentences while their eye movements were recorded, and they subsequently completed a battery of executive control and L2 proficiency tasks. High- and low-constraint sentences contained interlingual homographs (chat = 'casual conversation' in English, 'a cat' in French), cognates (piano in English and French), or L2-specific control words. The results showed that greater executive control among bilinguals but not L2 proficiency reduced cross-language activation in terms of interlingual homograph interference. In contrast, increased L2 proficiency but not executive control reduced cross-language activation in terms of cognate facilitation. These results suggest that models of bilingual reading must incorporate mechanisms by which domain-general executive control can alter the earliest stages of bilingual lexical activation.

	abstract = {We used eye movement measures of first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) paragraph reading to investigate whether the degree of current L2 exposure modulates the relative size of L1 and L2 frequency effects (FEs). The results showed that bilinguals displayed larger L2 than L1 FEs during both early- and late-stage eye movement measures, which are taken to reflect initial lexical access and postlexical access, respectively. Moreover, the magnitude of L2 FEs was inversely related to current L2 exposure, such that lower levels of L2 exposure led to larger L2 FEs. In contrast, during early-stage reading measures, bilinguals with higher levels of current L2 exposure showed larger L1 FEs than did bilinguals with lower levels of L2 exposure, suggesting that increased L2 experience modifies the earliest stages of L1 lexical access. Taken together, the findings are consistent with implicit learning accounts (e.g., Monsell, 1991), the weaker links hypothesis (Gollan, Montoya, Cera, Sandoval, Journal of Memory and Language, 58:787–814, 2008), and current bilingual visual word recognition models (e.g., the bilingual interactive activation model plus [BIA+]; Dijkstra \& van Heuven, Bilingualism: Language and Cognition, 5:175–197, 2002).

In Experiment 1, Russian words drew more eye movements and delayed English naming to a greater extent than control nonwords and English translation equivalents. In Experiment 2, Russian words spelled using English-specific letters drew more eye movements than control nonwords and English translation equivalents; however, both Russian words and nonword controls delayed English naming. Results of the two experiments suggest that nontarget-language information is processed during a target-language task. Recognition and production in bilinguals might function within distinct constraints, with recognition sensitive to lexical information (target and nontarget) and production sensitive to phonological information (lexical and nonlexical).},

In Experiment 1, subjects’ eye movements were monitored while they read English sentences in which sentence constraint, word frequency, and language of target word were manipulated. A frequency × constraint interaction was found when target words appeared in Spanish, but not in English. First fixation durations were longer for high-frequency Spanish words when these were embedded in high-constraint sentences than in low-constraint sentences. This result suggests that the conceptual restrictions produced by the sentence context were met, but that the lexical restrictions were not. The same result did not occur for low-frequency Spanish words, presumably because the slower access of low-frequency words provided more processing time for the resolution of this conflict. Similar results were found in Experiment 2 using rapid serial visual presentation when subjects named the target words aloud. It appears that sentence context effects are influenced by both semantic/conceptual and lexical information.},

In Experiment 1, participants read high and low constraint English (L1) sentences containing interlingual homographs, cognates, or control words. In Experiment 2, we included French (L2) filler sentences to increase salience of the L2 during L1 reading. The results suggest that bilinguals reading in their L1 show nonselective activation to the extent that they acquired their L2 early in life. Similar to our previous work on L2 reading, high contextual constraint attenuated cross-language activation for cognates. The inclusion of French filler items promoted greater cross-language activation, especially for late stage reading measures. Thus, L1 bilingual reading is modulated by L2 knowledge, semantic constraint, and task demands. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

No evidence for immediate homograph interference emerged during this period in the bilingual group. Only in later processing measures did group and congruency interact. Bilinguals may have initially accessed and selected the language appropriate meaning of the homograph to integrate into the sentence. Later, bilinguals accessed their first language lexicon and integrated the Spanish meaning into the sentence when semantically appropriate. Rather than always experiencing cross-language competition, proficient bilinguals may dynamically adapt to contextual cues and selectively access information associated with the contextually cued language under certain conditions.},

If nonselected lexical nodes are phonologically encoded, naming latencies should be shorter for cognate words, and because the cognate status of words is only meaningful for bilingual speakers, this difference should disappear when testing monolingual speakers. The results of Experiment 1 fully supported these predictions. In Experiment 2, the difference between cognate and noncognate words was larger when naming in the nondominant language than when naming in the dominant language.

The language-specific Experiments 1 and 2 replicated and qualified an earlier study (Dijkstra, Grainger, \& Van Heuven, 1999). In the generalized Experiment 3, participants reacted equally quickly on Dutch-English homographs and Dutch control words, indicating that their response was based primarily on the fastest available orthographic code (i.e., Dutch). In Experiment 4, cognates were recognized faster than English and Dutch controls, suggesting coactivation of the cognates’ semantics.

One piece of evidence is that bilinguals recognise cognates (words that are identical or similar in form and meaning in two languages) faster than non-cognates. The present study used cognates to investigate whether the non-selective access hypothesis holds also for trilinguals and three languages. Dutch-English-German trilinguals carried out a lexical decision task in their third language (German). The word materials included purely German control words, “double” cognates that overlapped in Dutch and German, but not in English, and “triple” cognates with the same form and meaning in Dutch, German, and English. Faster RTs were found for Dutch-German cognates than for control words, but additionally, “triple” cognates were processed even faster than “double” cognates. The “triple” cognate effect was not influenced by whether the participants had previously read an English text. A control experiment with German monolinguals confirmed that the effect was not an artifact of uncontrolled stimulus characteristics. Thus, independent of context, both the native language and another foreign non-target language influenced target language comprehension in trilinguals. This supports a view of language non-selective access implying all languages known to an individual may affect word activation and recognition.},

Cognate naming latencies were influenced by the cross-language match of the orthographic and phonological codes.

When the orthographic forms were dissimilar, the effects of the corresponding phonological match were not statistically reliable. The results suggest that lexical access is non-selective across bilinguals' two languages, and that the degree of consistency between orthographic and phonological codes influences the manner in which cross-language competition is manifest.

The L1 stimulus words were cognates with their translations in English, cognates with their translations in French, or were noncognates. In Experiments 1 and 2 with trilinguals who were highly proficient in English and relatively low in proficiency in French, we observed shorter word association and lexical decision times to the L1 words that were cognates with English than to the noncognates. In these relatively low-proficiency French speakers, response times (RTs) for the L1 words that were cognates with French did not differ from those for the noncognates. In Experiment 3, we tested Dutch-English- French trilinguals with a higher level of fluency in French (i.e., equally fluent in English and in French). We now observed faster responses on the L1 words that were cognates with French than on the noncognates. Lexical decision times to the cognates with English were also shorter than those to the noncognates. The results indicate that words presented in the dominant language, to naive participants, activate information in the nontarget, and weaker, language in parallel, implying that the multilinguals’ processing system is profoundly nonselective with respect to language. A minimal level of nontarget language fluency seems to be required, however, before any weaker language effects become noticeable in L1 processing.},

	abstract = {Southern Louisiana is the only effective remnant of the French presence in the Mississippi River valley during the lBth century.
During the colonial period, settled French Louisiana was a small
neglected parcel of the vast French North American empire. Later,
under the Spanish, it was seen as little more than a shield for New
Spain against Anglo-American encroachement.
Despite political Americanization in the early 19th century, rural
French Louisiana continued to grow as a distinctively French region.
In response to Anglo penetration, new environments were occupied and
mastered. ■' By 1900, southern Louisiana was a lively and discrete
culture region within the United states. It was, however,
compartmentalized, reflecting ethnic diversity within the French
population, diversity in physical geography, and class-based social
differentiation. A Louisiana-wide French consciousness had not been
achieved.
The 20th century brought better roads, radio, war, television,
industrialization, and more Anglos, leading to rapid cultural change.
Field work done in 1981 and 1982 examined changes in French Louisiana
culture in light of three major traditional markers: Catholic
religion, French language and food. It monitored the changing
geography of the region in terms of boundaries, internal cultural
change, and identity. The work attempts to establish whether these
changes suggest continuity, extinction, or some new form of ethnicity.
Analysis reveals that geographically, French Louisiana has begun
to Bhrink. Areas within the region have been changing at different
rates, however. The French language is Btill being eroded despite
efforts at revival. Religious indifference persists\vphantom{\{}\} the Catholic
Church does not function as an ethnic institution. The food, however,
remained very popular and has become the unifying element of the
culture region.
French Louisiana now uses ethnic politics and outside approval of
ethnicity to maintain itself: it has a state-recognized "official
territory" and a cultural capital, Lafayette. The Cajun identity has
been beautified and promoted as the new regional identity (but excludes
the non-white French population). The food, a national fad, has
replaced language as the most important element of the French Louisiana
culture. These changes suggest that traditional French Louisiana is
entering the American cultural mainstream.},

	abstract = {Variation across talkers in the acoustic-phonetic realization of speech sounds is a pervasive property of spoken language. The present study provides evidence that variation across talkers in the realization of American English stop consonants is highly structured. Positive voice onset time (VOT) was examined for all six word-initial stop categories in isolated productions of CVC syllables and in a multi-talker corpus of connected read speech. The mean VOT for each stop differed considerably across talkers, replicating previous findings, but importantly there were strong and statistically significant linear relations among the means (e.g., the mean VOTs of [pʰ] and [kʰ] were highly correlated across talkers, r{\textgreater}0.80). The pattern of VOT covariation was not reducible to differences in speaking rate or other factors known to affect the realization of stop consonants. These findings support a uniformity constraint on the talker-specific realization of a phonetic property, such as glottal spreading, that is shared by multiple speech sounds. Because uniformity implies mutual predictability, the findings also shed light on listeners׳ ability to generalize knowledge of a novel talker from one stop consonant to another. More broadly, structured variation of the kind investigated here indicates a relatively low-dimensional encoding of talker-specific phonetic realization in both speech production and speech perception.},

It is proposed that the linguistic landscape may serve important informational and symbolic functions as a marker of the relative power and status of the linguistic communities inhabiting the territory. Using the theoretical framework of ethnolinguistic vitality, it was hypothesized that the experience of the linguistic landscape by members of a language group may contribute to social psychological aspects of bilingual development. Factor analysis results show that the linguistic landscape emerges as a distinct factor separate from other measures of linguistic contacts. This factor was an important correlate of subjective ethnolinguistic vitality representing perceptions of the vitality of the in-group language in various domains. The study also found relations between the Linguistic Landscape factor and degree of in-group language use, especially in institutional settings, suggesting a 'carryover effect" of the linguistic landscape on language behavior.},

We present a variationist study of /θ/ and /ð/ in the speech of bilingual Cajuns in St. Landry Parish. The results show a complex interrelationship of age, gender, and social network. One of the major findings is a v-shaped age pattern rather than the regular generational model that is expected. The older generation use more of the dental variants [t, d] than all others, the middle-aged dramatically decrease their use, but the young show a level of usage closer to the old generation. The change is attributed to both language attrition and the blossoming of the Cajun cultural renaissance. Interestingly, neither young men in open networks nor women of all ages in open networks follow the v-shaped age pattern. In addition, they show opposite directions of change: men in open networks lead the change to [d], whereas women in open networks drop the dental variants of [t, d] almost entirely.},

Specifically, we focus on features such as part of speech, duration, F0 contour pattern, relative height of the peak F0, energy trajectory pattern, and relative height of the peak energy at the final part of speech segments. We examine, first, the relationship between turn-taking/backchannels and each feature of speech segments independently, showing that the features examined in this study are all related to turn-taking or backchannels and that the way they correlate is fairly consistent with previous studies. Next, we explore the inter-relationship among the features with respect to turn-taking and backchannels. We show that in both turn-taking and backchannels, (I) some instances of syntactic features make extremely strong contributions, and (2) in general, syntax has a stronger contribution than any individual prosodic feature, although the whole prosody contributes as strongly as, or even more strongly than, syntax. We also discuss some implications of our results, comparing them with previous models that have mentioned roles of syntax and prosody in turn-taking and backchannels.},

	doi = {10.1016/0010-0277(83)90026-4},
	abstract = {Making a self-repair in speech typically proceeds in three phases. The first phase involves the monitoring of one's own speech and the interruption of the flow of speech when trouble is detected. From an analysis of 959 spontaneous self-repairs it appears that interrupting follows detection promptly, with the exception that correct words tend to be completed. Another finding is that detection of trouble improves towards the end of constituents. The second phase is characterized by hesitation, pausing, but especially the use of so-called editing terms. Which editing term is used depends on the nature of the speech trouble in a rather regular fashion: Speech errors induce other editing terms than words that are merely inappropriate, and trouble which is detected quickly by the speaker is preferably signalled by the use of ‘uh’. The third phase consists of making the repair proper. The linguistic well-formedness of a repair is not dependent on the speaker's respecting the integrity of constituents, but on the structural relation between original utterance and repair. A bi-conditional well-formedness rule links this relation to a corresponding relation between the conjuncts of a coordination. It is suggested that a similar relation holds also between question and answer. In all three cases the speaker respects certain structural commitments derived from an original utterance. It was finally shown that the editing term plus the first word of the repair proper almost always contain sufficient information for the listener to decide how the repair should be related to the original utterance. Speakers almost never produce misleading information in this respect. It is argued that speakers have little or no access to their speech production process; self-monitoring is probably based on parsing one's own inner or overt speech.
Résumé
L'auto-correction dans le discours se fait typiquement en trois temps. Dans un premier temps, le locuteur contrôle sa propre parole et l'interrompt lorsqu'il rencontre un problème. Une analyse de 959 corrections spontanées indique que l'interruption suit de très près la perception du problème, à l'exception près que le locuteur a tendance à finir les mots corrects. Les résultats de cette analyse indiquent d'autre part que la perception du problème s'améliore vers la fin des constituants. Le deuxième temps se caractérise par des hésitations, des pauses, mais surtout par l'utilisation de ce qu' on peut appeler les ‘commentaires rédactionnels’. Ceux-ci sont liés de façon suffisamment régulaire à la correction particulière qui est faite: ils sont différents lorsqu'il s'agit d'une véritable erreur et lorsqu'il s'agit simplement d'une mauvaise tournure de phrase. La présence immédiate du problème est signalée par l'utilisation de ‘uh’. Dans le troisième temps a lieu la correction elle-même. La bonne-formation des corrections ne dépend pas de ce que le locuteur respecte l'intégrité des constituants, mais plutôt de la relation structurelle qui existe entre le premier énoncé et la correction. Cette relation est liée à la relation correspondante entre les éléments conjoints d'une coordination par une règle de bonne formation bi-conditionnelle. On peut également suggérer qu'il existe une relation semblable entre questions et réponses. Dans ces trois cas, le locuteur respecte les contraintes structurelles de son premier énoncé. Enfin, l'analyse démontre que l'ensemble formé par le ‘commentaire rédactionnel’ et le premier mot de la correction elle-même contient presque toujours des éléments d'information permettant à l'interlocuteur de décider comment il faut relier la correction au premier énoncé. De ce point de vue, les locuteurs ne produisent presque jamais d'énoncés qui pourraient induire leur interlocuteur en erreur. Ces résultats indiquent que le locuteur a peu ou pas du tout d'accès au processus de production d'énoncés; l'auto-contrôle se fait plutôt à partir de la compréhension de sa propre parole intérieure ou extérieure.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for automatically detecting disﬂuencies in spontaneous speech – speciﬁcally, selfcorrections – that explicitly models repetitions vs. other disﬂuencies. We show that, in a corpus of Supreme Court oral arguments, repetition disﬂuencies can be longer and more stutterlike than the short repetitions observed in the Switchboard corpus and suggest that they can be better represented with a ﬂat structure that covers the full sequence. Since these disﬂuencies are relatively easy to detect, weakly supervised training is an effective way to minimize labeling costs. By explicitly modeling these, we improve general disﬂuency detection within and across domains, and we provide a richer transcript.},

In this paper we compare the performance of a few POS tagging techniques for Bangla language, e.g. statistical approach (n-gram, HMM) and transformation based approach (Brill’s tagger). A supervised POS tagging approach requires a large amount of annotated training corpus to tag properly. At this initial stage of POS-tagging for Bangla, we have very limited resource of annotated corpus. We tried to see which technique maximizes the performance with this limited resource. We also checked the performance for English and tried to conclude how these techniques might perform if we can manage a substantial amount of annotated corpus.},

The study makes use of 10 hours of French radio interview archives, involving journalists and personalities from political or civil society. A first type of transcripts is press-oriented: most disfluencies are discarded. For 10\% of the corpus, we produced exact audio transcripts: all audible phenomena and overlapping speech segments are transcribed manually. In these transcripts, about 14\% of the words correspond to disfluencies and discourse markers. The audio corpus has then been transcribed using the LIMSI speech recogniser. With 8\% of the corpus, the disfluency words explain 12\% of the overall error rate. This shows that disfluencies have no major effect on neighbouring speech segments. Restarts are the most error prone, with a 36.9\% within class error rate.},

DisMo is a hybrid system that uses a combination of lexical resources, rules, and statistical models based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF). In this paper, we present the first public version of DisMo for French. The system is trained and its performance evaluated on a 57k-token corpus, including different varieties of French spoken in three countries (Belgium, France and Switzerland). DisMo supports a multi-level annotation scheme, in which the tokenisation to minimal word units is complemented with multi-word unit groupings (each having associated POS tags), as well as separate levels for annotating disfluencies and discourse phenomena. We present the system's architecture, linguistic resources and its hierarchical tag-set. Results show that DisMo achieves a precision of 95\% (finest tag-set) to 96.8\% (coarse tag-set) in POS-tagging non-punctuated, sound-aligned transcriptions of spoken French, while also offering substantial possibilities for automated multi-level annotation.},

The study reported here demonstrates a previously unrecognised influence of vision upon speech perception. It stems from an observation that, on being shown a film of a young woman's talking head, in which repeated utterances of the syllable [ba] had been dubbed on to lip movements for [ga], normal adults reported hearing [da]. With the reverse dubbing process, a majority reported hearing [bagba] or [gaba]. When these subjects listened to the soundtrack from the film, without visual input, or when they watched untreated film, they reported the syllables accurately as repetitions of [ba] or [ga]. Subsequent replications confirm the reliability of these findings; they have important implications for the understanding of speech perception.},

The present study provides a more direct test on the question of anomaly formulation by examining laboratory-generated spoonerism errors in which emotionally neutral target words may be transformed into obscene error utterances.

However, whether word-length effects in single word production exist is at present controversial. A series of experiments did not find evidence for such an effect. First, an experimental manipulation of word length in picture naming showed no latency differences. Second, Dutch and English speakers named 2 sets of either objects or words (monosyllabic names in Dutch and disyllabic names in English or vice versa). A length effect, which should manifest itself as an interaction between object set and response language, emerged in word naming but not in picture naming. Third, distractors consisting of the final syllable of disyllabic object names speeded up responses, but at the same time, no word-length effect was found. These results suggest that before the response is initiated, an entire word has been phonologically encoded, but only its initial syllable is placed in an articulatory buffer.

We describe an experiment designed to follow up on this result in a New Zealand context. Participants listened to a New Zealand English (NZE) speaker reading a list of sentences. Each sentence appeared on the answer-sheet, with a target word underlined. For each sentence, participants were asked to select from a synthesized vowel continuum the token that best matched the target vowel produced by the speaker. Half the participants had an answer-sheet with the word ‘Australian’ written on it, and half had an answer-sheet with ‘New Zealander’ written on it. Participants in the two conditions behaved significantly differently from one another. For example, they were more likely to hear a higher fronter /i/ vowel when ‘Australian’ appeared on the answer sheet, and more likely to hear a centralized version when ‘New Zealander’ appeared – a trend which reflects production differences between the two dialects. This is despite the fact that nearly all participants reported that they knew they were listening to a New Zealander. We discuss the implication of these results, and argue that they support exemplar models of speech perception.},

	abstract = {Understanding worldwide patterns of language diversity has long been a goal for evolutionary scientists, linguists and philosophers. Research over the past decade has suggested that linguistic diversity may result from differences in the social environments in which languages evolve. Specifically, recent work found that languages spoken in larger communities typically have more systematic grammatical structures. However, in the real world, community size is confounded with other social factors such as network structure and the number of second languages learners in the community, and it is often assumed that linguistic simplification is driven by these factors instead. Here, we show that in contrast to previous assumptions, community size has a unique and important influence on linguistic structure. We experimentally examine the live formation of new languages created in the laboratory by small and larger groups, and find that larger groups of interacting participants develop more systematic languages over time, and do so faster and more consistently than small groups. Small groups also vary more in their linguistic behaviours, suggesting that small communities are more vulnerable to drift. These results show that community size predicts patterns of language diversity, and suggest that an increase in community size might have contributed to language evolution.},

The data consist of 13,167 tokens of (ING) from interviews with 132 speakers conducted in Raleigh, North Carolina. Results from mixed-effect logistic regression show a strong effect of frequency on the realization of (ING), and this effect interacts with phonological context of occurrence. Frequent occurrence in environments that favor -in amplify the effect of lexical frequency; conversely, frequent occurrence in environments that favor –ing dampen the effect of overall frequency. Frequency also interacts with year of birth, showing an entrenchment of high-frequency words, lagging behind the community change toward the –ing variant in apparent time. Overall, these findings support the usage-based position of frequency effects as the result of a dynamic interplay between context of use and cognitive systems.},

(ING) was used as the variable of study for its well-studied internal constraints and comparability to previous studies on the internal constraints of t/d deletion. A lexical category constraint hierarchy for the community was determined via multivariate mixed-effects statistical models, and each speaker's (ING) pattern was compared to this hierarchy. Results show maintenance in grammatical constraints even when taking phonological factors into account, unlike some work on t/d deletion. Uniformity exists across speakers with respect to the ordering of internal constraints despite the overall decline in rates of –in over time, but constraint weights (expressed as log odds) vary significantly from speaker to speaker, with no correlates to social or internal factors. These results have consequences for representation of individuals in terms of an aggregate pattern, questioning the consistency of factor weight values at the speaker level despite consistent ordering of constraints.},

In this paper, we compare the effect of noise reduction techniques on the acoustic signal and evaluate their effect on acoustic speech data. We use Praat to detect the quietest silence (measured using root-mean-square amplitude) in each sound file. The audio data contain silences that lack background noise (e.g., due to anonymization procedures), but these are excluded from selection. Each quietest silence is used to create a “noise profile,” which is removed from the audio using a scripted noise removal procedure in both Audacity and SoX. The success of each procedure is assessed with three-way comparisons of the amplitude of silences in uncleaned and cleaned audio, and vowel plots made with formant values extracted from uncleaned and cleaned audio. It is predicted that successful noise reduction will reduce the number of outliers occurring in F1, F2 space.},

Affect control theory, a quantified version of symbolic interactionism, predicts that individuals adopt strategies which maintain their identities in order to secure a stable definition of the situation. When individuals have low self-esteem, they select interactions that maintain this low self-esteem, even when these interactions cause negative emotions. Two experiments examined the cognitive, affective, and behavioral effects of identity-confirming and -disconfirming information. Study 1, which assessed the cognitive and emotional outcomes of identity-relevant feedback, revealed that people with both high and low self-esteem feel good when praised and bad when they receive negative feedback on their performance. People with low self-esteem, however, think that the criticism is accurate, and like the critic more than do people with high self-esteem. Study 2 examined the implications of these responses for social interaction. Consistent with affect control predictions, subjects selected interaction partners who provided identity-consistent feedback. People with low self-esteem preferred to interact with a critic rather than with someone who said flattering things about their performance, even though the negative feedback made them feel bad. We discuss our results in terms of their implications for role stability and for the behavior of people with chronically negative self-identities.]},

Our aim is to understand better why speech recognition systems still fail to achieve good performances on spontaneous speech. Using Nakamura's method {\textbackslash}cite\{nakamura2008\}, we use classical speech recognition features, MFCC, and try to represent the effects of the speaking styles on the spectral space. We happen to find some cues, and it also seems that phone duration also plays an important role regarding spectral reduction, especially for spontaneous speech.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the reduction of vowel /e/ in the French word c’était /setε/ ‘it was’. This reduction phenomenon appeared to be highly frequent, as more than half of the occurrences of this word in a corpus of casual French contained few or no acoustic traces of a vowel between [s] and [t]. All our durational analyses clearly supported a categorical absence of vowel /e/ in a subset of c’était tokens. This interpretation was also supported by our finding that the occurrence of complete elision and [e] duration in non-elision tokens were conditioned by different factors. However, spectral measures were consistent with the possibility that a highly reduced /e/ vowel is still present in elision tokens in spite of the durational evidence for categorical elision. We discuss how these findings can be reconciled, and conclude that acoustic analysis of uncontrolled materials can provide valuable information about the mechanisms underlying reduction phenomena in casual speech.},

Our data reveal significant differences in how these segments are realized in each language. Spanish voiceless stops tend to have shorter stop closures, display incomplete closures more often, and exhibit more voicing than French voiceless stops. As for vowels, more cases of complete devoicing and greater degrees of partial devoicing were found in French than in Spanish. Moreover, all French vowel types exhibit significantly lower F1 values than their Spanish counterparts. These findings indicate that the extent of reduction that a segment type can undergo in conversational speech can vary significantly across languages. Language differences in coarticulatory strategies and “base-of-articulation” are discussed as possible causes of our observations.},

We also show that a considerable amount of relevant phonetic and visual information is present before the last portion of the utterances, potentially assisting early speech act recognition by addressees.

De l'analyse exhaustive du corpus se dégage un modèle d'adresse sous forme de syntagme ainsi qu'un modèle du fonctionnement de son échange. Mais on s'aperçoit que le rendement des informations diffusées par ces deux modèles est nul. On se demande alors si à la lumière de textes de sociologues, psychologues et philosophes contemporains le système d'adresse dans sa force apodictique ne peut être envisagé comme une sorte de rituel destiné à perpétuer la domination des parents. Systems of address are usually studied on the premisses that each time an individual wants to open or close a speech communication with another individual or a group, the linguistic pattern he uses reflects the social and affective quality of their relationship. A thorough analysis of the data leads to the generation of a model of address as well as that of a model of exchange. But one finds evidence that the output of informations released by this two models is close to nothing. Thus the question one may ask itself is : is there any occulted value underlying the all structure ? Recent research dealing with sociology, psychoanalysis and philosophy shows that the system of address could be seen as a kind of ritual which would assess the parental authority.]},

	copyright = {Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.},
	abstract = {This dissertation is a quantitative treatment of the nature of variation and change in linguistic structures in Cajun French, a stigmatized variety spoken in southwest Louisiana. A main tenet of variation theory holds that variation is an inherent and rule-governed property of human languages constrained by both linguistic and social conditioning environments. Studies in this area attempt to discover the systematicity of variability within the social context of the language. Recent studies in varieties of French have illustrated that the pronoun systems are highly unstable, thus well-suited to this sort of linguistic inquiry. Thibault 1986 studies that the grammaticalization of third person pronouns and the growing frequency of the traditionally inanimate pronoun ca 'that' referring a definite, animate pronoun. The research in this study extends the investigation of the grammaticalization of personal pronouns, using the thus far unexplored source of Cajun French. The fluid state of the pronominal system in Cajun is often alluded to in the literature, however, the subject has not yet been pursued for analysis. This study, therefore, assumes the task of analyzing the variability in third person pronouns, and in particular, the linguistic and social factors conditioning the behavior of c ca.
The social context is particularly significant in this research for several distinctive and influential characteristics of the language. First, Cajun is a minority language under the constant pressure of a majority language, English. Linguistic change and variation is thus seen in light of such forces which could over a period of time alter syntactic structures. Second, the language is oral which renders it highly susceptible to variation from a historical written norm. Third, the Cajun culture is experiencing a revival movement instilling a sense of pride among the speakers and lending prestige to the variety. While for some time Cajun was rapidly losing native speakers, the revival may halt this trend.
The results indicate that the "weakening trend" in the Cajun pronoun system suggested in the literature can, in fact, be supported by systematic statistical analysis. Furthermore, the analysis points to innovations in pronominal usage as well as evidence suggesting the linguistic pressure of English.},

	abstract = {Efforts to preserve the spoken French of Louisiana have raised the question of which variety of French should be taught or which variants among all varieties could serve as acceptable components of a pedagogical norm. Proposals have ranged from imposing a standard French norm to teaching a selected dialect of Cajun French. The present study surveys usage patterns and language attitudes of Cajun French speakers located in fourteen parishes (counties) of southern Louisiana. Twenty-seven informants are interviewed in a pilot study; forty-nine English/Cajun French bilinguals, representing three socio-economic categories, are the focus of the main study. Five morphological variables are examined specifically: (1) The second-person formal--vous parlez vs. vous parle (you speak); (2) The future tense--elle parlera vs. elle va parler (she will speak); (3) The auxiliary etre (to be)--il est venu vs. il a venu (he came); (4) The third-person plural--ils jouent vs. ils jouont vs. ca joue (they play); (5) The interrogative"what"--qu'est-ce que vs. quoi vs. qui (what?)
The results reveal a general reduction of inflectional verb morphology, a tendency to replace synthetic with analytic forms, a reduction of allomorphs, and the geographical distribution of certain variants. Informant attitudes toward each of the variants, determined by informal observations and by a preference test, are compared with informant usage. The findings yield evidence that in this language contact, language death situation (where English dominates Cajun French) no general unified norm develops in the inferior language, a notion which in turn implies that any norm prescribed for that language must respect local usage patterns in order to be generally accepted. Recommendations for the nature of that norm are presented accordingly.},

	abstract = {The attention of linguists has only recently been drawn to the phenomenon of declining minority languages, and the field of inquiry has begun to prove to be a very fruitful one. Perhaps most importantly, dying languages change very quickly, thus providing a unique opportunity for the linguist to study language change. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the changes experienced by dying languages are "unnatural", which has important implications for how linguists handle data from such languages. In this study I examine a Cajun French-speaking community in the context of the study of language decline. This study is valuable not only in its contribution to research on language death in general, but also for its contribution to what is known of Cajun French, a little-studied variety in rapid decline which must therefore be documented soon or not at all. The research involved fieldwork in which I interviewed and taped over 80 speakers of Cajun French in the fall of 1993 and spring 1994, and transcribed these interviews. The study includes two components, a social one and a linguistic one. In the social component I examine changes across time in the patterns of usage of French and English in Louisiana, and examine some of the social correlates of language choice among bilinguals in Louisiana, such as the ethnicity (Native American versus Cajun French), sex, and age of the speaker. In the linguistic component I examine several aspects of the grammar of Cajun French in order to explore the new variety of the language which is emerging as the language declines. The emergent variety differs in some striking ways from that of the traditional norms of the community, and my study serves both to confirm some of the findings from studies of other declining languages, and to report some new patterns the details of which are not attested elsewhere.},

One of the aspects considered to contribute to a more 'simplified' structure is the replacement of synthetic structures by analytic ones. Analyticity and syntheticity have played a role in language typology, and the cycle is of particular interest in the Romance languages, where Latin is considered the synthetic language par excellence, while French is generally regarded as being highly analytic in comparison. Schwegler (1990) redefines analytic and synthetic, predicating these notions on the spoken, as opposed to the written, language.
This dissertation analyzes the verb group, consisting of the subject and object clitics and the verb, of Cajun French, an enclave language spoken in Louisiana, that has been isolated from the influence of Standard French for some 200 years. The analysis is based on Schwegler's (1990) new definitions of analyticity and syntheticity, which are especially appropriate for this dialect because it has no written form. The data reveal that Cajun French shares many common features with Informal Spoken French, and the net result is that Cajun French is far more synthetic than an analysis based on the written standard would yield.},

In carrying out the above, the Commission was directed to consider: (i) the boundaries between biomedical and behavioral research and the accepted and routine practice of medicine, (ii) the role of assessment of risk-benefit criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of research involving human subjects, (iii) appropriate guidelines for the selection of human subjects for participation in such research and (iv) the nature and definition of informed consent in various research settings.},

Nine boys and nine girls were selected from each of the three grades, and close to 1000 words of writing were obtained from each student. The writing was done in class without alteration by anyone other than the writer, and the subject matter was not controlled by the investigators. In addition to sentence length, clause length, subordination ratio, and the kinds  of clauses, the study analyzes structures within a clause: coordinated structures, nominals, the verb auxiliary, main verbs and complements, modifiers of verbs, and predicate adjectives. The results of this study are discussed at length, and tables provide additional information about the procedures used and data obtained. This report was written for two groups: the teacher or supervisor of English and the researcher in language development. (RB)},

Sont également soulevées, d'une part, la question du passage, au niveau des interactions verbales individuelles, du vouvoiement au tutoiement - et du tutoiement au vouvoiement -, et d'autre part, celle des usages marqués auxquels se prêtent les pronoms d'adresse.

One question that remains unanswered is the extent to which stylistic variation is the result of automatic alignment or of intentional, pragmatically motivated adjustment. We present an in-depth sociolinguistic case study of a 10-year-old boy, his family and four friends selected according to their place of birth and the duration of their relationship with the boy. Statistical analyses of sociolinguistic variables of French suggest that the child's use of these variants is influenced by pragmatic motivations but not by automatic alignment. La variation stylistique est bien décrite chez l’adulte. Toutefois, sa forme, ses mécanismes et ses fonctions ontogénétiques doivent être davantage étudiés chez l’enfant. Une question concerne notamment le degré auquel cette variation résulte d’un alignement automatique sur les usages de l’interlocuteur ou d’un ajustement intentionnel, fondé sur des motivations pragmatiques. Nous présentons une étude de cas approfondie d’un garçon de dix ans enregistré avec sa famille et quatre amis sélectionnés selon leur lieu de naissance et la durée de la relation amicale qui les lie à l’enfant cible. L’analyse statistique de variables sociolinguistiques du français suggère que cet enfant est capable d’ajustements subtils en fonction de l’identité des interlocuteurs. Plutôt que d’être sous-tendus par un alignement mimétique sur les usages d’autrui, ces ajustements semblent fondés sur des motivations pragmatiques et identitaires.},

Interactive alignment occurs via automatic alignment channels that are functionally similar to the automatic links between perception and behaviour (the so-called perception–behaviour expressway) proposed in recent accounts of social interaction. We conclude that humans are ‘designed’ for dialogue rather than monologue.},

	abstract = {The ability to discern the use of a nonstandard dialect is often enough information to also determine the speaker?s ethnicity, and speakers may consequently suffer discrimination based on their speech. This article, detailing four experiments, shows that housing discrimination based solely on telephone conversations occurs, dialect identification is possible using the word hello, and phonetic correlates of dialect can be discovered. In one experiment, a series of telephone surveys was conducted; housing was requested from the same landlord during a short time period using standard and nonstandard dialects. The results demonstrate that landlords discriminate against prospective tenants on the basis of the sound of their voice during telephone conversations. Another experiment was conducted with untrained participants to confirm this ability; listeners identified the dialects significantly better than chance. Phonetic analysis reveals that phonetic variables potentially distinguish the dialects.},

	abstract = {Southwest Louisiana Creoles underwent great change between World Wars I and II as they confronted American culture, people, and norms. This work examines that cultural transformation, paying particular attention to the processes of cultural assimilation and resistance to the introduction and imposition of American social values and its southern racial corollary: Jim Crow. As this work makes clear, the transition to American identity transmuted the cultural foundations of French- and Creole-speaking Creole communities. World War I signalled early transformative changes and over the next three decades, the region saw the introduction of English language, new industries, an increasing number of Protestant denominations, and the forceful imposition of racialized identities and racial segregation. Assimilation and cultural resistance characterized the Creole response, but by 1945, southwest Louisiana more closely resembled much of the American South. Creole leaders in churches, schools, and the tourism industry offered divergent reactions; some elite Creoles began looking to Francophone Canada for whitened ethnic identity support while others turned toward the Catholic establishment in Baltimore, Maryland to bolster their faith. Creoles were not the only distinct community to undergo Americanization, but Louisiana Creoles were singular in their response. As this study makes clear – in ways no historian has previously documented – Louisiana Creoles bifurcated as a result of Americanization. This study also contributes to, and broadens, the literature on Acadian identity. Previously, scholars simply assumed that whitened Latins in Louisiana had always identified with Acadia and their black-racialized brethren with Haiti. This thesis, however, suggests that Cajun and Creole are not opposites. Rather, they derive from the same people and culture, and their perceived and articulated difference emerged in response to Americanization. Through a critical analysis of that bifurcation process, this thesis demonstrates how Acadianized identity and culture emerged in the first half of the 20th century.},

Section 2 evaluates Creole-formation hypotheses, including claims about the lesser grammatical complexity of Creoles and about an exceptional ‘Creole typology’ outside the scope of the Comparative Method in historical linguistics. Section 3 offers the sketch of a framework for a Null Theory of Creole Formation (NTC) that excludes sui generis stipulations about Creole formation and Creole languages and that is rooted in UG, as it applies to all languages.

On this view, similarities between child-English and adult-German are as unsurprising as similarities between cousins who have never met. By contrast, experience-based approaches to language acquisition contend that child language matches the input, with nonadult forms being simply less articulated versions of the forms produced by adults. This paper reports several studies that provide support for the theory of Universal grammar, and resist explanation on experience-based accounts. Two studies investigate English-speaking children’s productions, and a third examines the interpretation of sentences by Japanese speaking children. When considered against the input children are exposed to, the findings of these and other studies are consistent with the continuity hypothesis, which supposes that child language can differ from the language spoken by adults only in ways that adult languages can differ from each other.},

It is a handbook of research on African American Language (AAL) and, as such, provides a variety of scholarly perspectives that may not align with each other -- as is indicative of most scholarly research. The chapters in this book "interact" with one another as contributors frequently refer the reader to further elaboration on and references to related issues and connect their own research to related topics in other chapters within their own sections and the handbook more generally to create dialogue about AAL, thus affirming the need for collaborative thinking about the issues in AAL research. Though the Handbook does not and cannot include every area of research, it is meant to provide suggestions for future work on lesser-studied areas (e.g., variation/heterogeneity in regional, social, and ethnic communities) by highlighting a need for collaborative perspectives and innovative thinking while reasserting the need for better research and communication in areas thought to be resolved.},

	volume = {16},
	doi = {10.1075/jpcl.16.2.02mye},
	abstract = {This paper argues that the motivation for structure in creole formation comes from the innate architecture of language competence and production. In this architecture, the lexical and the grammatical subsystems of language are related, but supported differently. At the level of the mental lexicon, abstract entries (lemmas) underlie morphemes, but lemmas project content morphemes differently than grammatical morphemes. While the abstract frames that grammatical morphemes will ﬁll are present at this level (referred to in lemmas supporting content morphemes) the grammatical morphemes are not salient until the level of the Formulator. The Formulator assembles surface-level constituents based on directions it receives from lemmas. This view of abstract conﬁgurations in language supports the claim that there are two initial targets in creole formation. These targets are: (1) input from substrates as a target for the grammatical (morphosyntactic) frame of utterances, and (2) superstrate input as another target for most of the content morphemes that appear in the creole as lexical elements or that are reconﬁgured to ﬁll requirements of the grammatical frame. Thus, the overall claim is that the initial form of a creole is constrained by universally-present blueprinting of how linguistic elements are related and how they become available.},

The two communities with least contact with supralocal French preserve the highly salient imperfect subjunctive, moribund or absent from most other present-day spoken French varieties. While four communities exhibit high selection rates for the present subjunctive, in line with variationist analyses of other French varieties, one community has surprisingly low rates of such usage, along with absence of the imperfect subjunctive. This dichotomy is explained by the local prestige of the smaller of two founder groups for the community, settlers from Haute-Bretagne, France, a dialect area for which the historical record reveals low levels of subjunctive forms. The results highlight the importance not only of demographic factors but also of local identity construction in the formation of new contact varieties.},

	abstract = {Looking like a Language, Sounding like a Race examines the emergence of linguistic and ethnoracial categories in the context of Latinidad. The book draws from more than twenty-four months of ethnographic and sociolinguistic fieldwork in a Chicago public school, whose student body is more than 90\% Mexican and Puerto Rican, to analyze the racialization of language and its relationship to issues of power and national identity. It focuses specifically on youth socialization to U.S. Latinidad as a contemporary site of political anxiety, raciolinguistic transformation, and urban inequity.  Jonathan Rosa's account studies the fashioning of Latinidad in Chicago's highly segregated Near Northwest Side; he links public discourse concerning the rising prominence of U.S. Latinidad to the institutional management and experience of raciolinguistic identities there. Anxieties surrounding Latinx identities push administrators to transform "at risk" Mexican and Puerto Rican students into "young Latino professionals." This institutional effort, which requires students to learn to be and, importantly, sound like themselves in highly studied ways, reveals administrators' attempts to navigate a precarious urban terrain in a city grappling with some of the nation's highest youth homicide, dropout, and teen pregnancy rates. Rosa explores the ingenuity of his research participants' responses to these forms of marginalization through the contestation of political, ethnoracial, and linguistic borders.},

Scholars have explored ways that non-African Americans worldwide use linguistic features of African American English (AAE) as a way of constructing hip-hop affiliated identities. The current paper ties these strands together in a study of the linguistic patterns of white Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, who makes use of AAE in her music, but not in other public speech. Our study presents a variationist analysis of copula absence in her lyrics. Findings show that her rates of this hallmark feature of AAE are extremely high, when compared to similar analyses of other rappers. We argue that her overzealous application of AAE features in her music, in order to create a specific linguistic style, enables a success that rests ultimately on the appropriation of African American language and culture, and the privilege that whiteness affords.},

	abstract = {Hip-hop language (HHL) is a hot topic in academia. Sociolinguists have been interested in its relationship to African American English as well as innovations in terms of its grammar and vocabulary. A couple of questions connect research from a number of related fields on HHL and culture: What does it mean to be authentic in hip-hop culture in terms of language and other aspects of identity such as one's race, class, and connection to young urban Black Americans? How do participants perform their hip-hop identity in terms of language? And how do local hip-hop scenes use language to express local identities? This article explores research on these topics as it pertains to HHL, also taking into account a range of disciplines from cultural studies and philosophy to musicology, identifying new trends and possible areas for collaboration, and highlighting areas that are in need of greater attention. The article also touches on frameworks for analyzing language use in general in such areas as ‘crossing’ and ‘styling’.},

	isbn = {978-90-272-5244-9},
	abstract = {Basic notions in the field of creole studies, including the category of creole languages itself, have been questioned in recent years: Can creoles be defined on structural or on purely sociohistorical grounds? Can creolization be understood as a graded process, possibly resulting in different degrees of radicalness and intermediate language types (semi-creoles)? If so, by which linguistic structures are these characterized, and by which extralinguistic conditions have they been brought about? Which are the linguistic mechanisms underlying processes of restructuring, and how did grammaticalization and reanalysis shape the reorganization of linguistic, specifically morphosyntactic structures commonly called creolization? What is the role of language contact, language mixing, substrates and superstrates, or demographic factors in these processes? This volume provides select and revised papers from a 1998 colloquium at the University of Regensburg in which these questions were addressed. 19 contributions by renowned scholars discuss structural, sociohistorical and theoretical aspects, building upon case studies of both Romance-based and English-oriented creoles. This book marks a major step forward in our understanding of the nature of creolization.},

Accordingly, this literature abounds with discussions on whether some specific grammatical change is due to the former or the latter.

This is largely due to the fact that research on SLA is focused on individuals rather than on communities of speakers producing their own separate norms, whereas genetic creolistics deals precisely with this particular aspect of language change and speciation. It is not enough to prove that transfer from the first to the second language is possible and can evolve into substrate influence on the emergent vernaculars—transfer is not ineluctable and varies from one learner to another. Additionally, how and why particular features of some speakers spread to a whole population (or to parts thereof), whereas others do not, must be accounted for. Consistent with colonial socioeconomic history, the gradual emergence of creoles suggests a complex evolution that cannot be accounted for with simplistic invocations of either interlanguage or relexification. This article presents limitations in the cross-pollination that has been expected from genetic creolistics and research on SLA.},

The present study examined this issue in the context of idiom comprehension. Bilingual adults differing in prior brokering experience read English idioms and judged whether target words presented in English or Spanish were related to the idiom's meaning. For brokers, relatedness judgments were not affected by whether the targets were in the same or different language as the idiom; however, non-brokers were faster for same-language than different-language idiom-target pairings. The findings suggest that language brokering experience facilitates idiom meaning comprehension even across language boundaries, with further differences related to idiom decomposability. More generally, the findings underscore the importance of considering systematic sources of variability in language practice among bilinguals, aside from differences related to proficiency, in theorizing effects associated with bilingualism.},

African American speakers in North America are often analyzed from an ethnolectal perspective, and placed in contrast to (white) speakers of regional varieties of American English. A close analysis of three features – one that is traditionally ethnolectal (copula absence as a feature of African American English), one that is traditionally dialectal (bought-raising as a feature of New York City English), and one that is potentially either (non-rhoticity in the syllable coda) – reveals intersectional identification practices that go beyond ethnicity and regional identity. The results of a variationist analysis of a community sample of speakers from the Lower East Side of Manhattan is contrasted with a micro-analysis of the repertoire of a single speaker, with the repertoire analysis demonstrating the fluid nature of speaker identity and of the boundaries between ethnolect and dialect in New York City.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a study that attributes verb serialization in the interlanguage of Vietnamese-speaking ESL learners to language transfer and, furthermore, puts forward the view that such transfer bears a resemblance to substrate influence in creoles with serial verb constructions (SVCs). In a task that elicited English causatives through pictures representing the causation of events, a subset of the Vietnamese-speaking participants in this study produced a number of serial-type constructions that reflected lexicosemantic aspects of causative SVCs in Vietnamese. Speakers of Hindi-Urdu, a nonserializing language used for comparative purposes, did not produce any equivalents. Additionally, serial-type constructions with second verbs (V2s) representing a result (e.g., cook butter melt) predominated at lower levels of lexical proficiency, whereas serials with make and a result (e.g., make broken) were more evenly distributed across proficiency levels. One inference based on the results is that certain serials are eliminated early in the acquisition process through positive evidence obtained via English input, whereas others continue to appear beyond the elementary level because of misleadingly similar constructions in the input. A comparison of the proficiency-based transfer of “cook butter melt” serials in this study and the inferred transfer of SVCs in creolization suggests that, whereas transfer processes in the two contexts are congruent in certain ways (often resulting from the exigencies of communication, limited access to the TL, and linguistic convergence), the processes diverge because of differences in target norms and input conditions. The latter two factors provide one explanation for why SVC-related transfer effects were limited to a subgroup of Vietnamese-speaking participants in this study.},

In this study, we begin with indexical recognition – the perceptual identification of speakers’ self-identified ethnic groups – to determine whether speakers produce ethnolinguistic variation and whether listeners are sensitive to it. Speech samples were recorded from thirty individuals from Metro Vancouver who self-identified as Chinese, East Indian, or White Canadian. These utterances were used in a perception task where listeners categorized speakers’ ethnicities. Listeners’ social networks were labeled according to the ethnic group with which they reported spending the most time. Analyses indicate that while speakers vary in their productive expression of ethnolinguistic variation, listeners are consistent in their labeling choices. Listener accuracy was higher for voices from the listeners’ reported social group and White voices. These results suggest that familiarity with ethnic groups through social networks and mainstream culture influences indexical recognition.},

In a time where scholarly and public conceptualizations of race and ethnicity are variable and rapidly changing, potential effects on both self-identification and ways of speaking present an area ripe for study. However, linguistics and allied fields have often overlooked individuals and communities that do not neatly conform to well-defined racial categories. As multiracially identified individuals are one of the fastest growing demographic groups in the United States, researchers will necessarily need to address the way that traditional methodologies have excluded individuals and groups who fall outside of these racial and ethnic categories. This presents a unique challenge for sociolinguistics in particular, since we are interested in how people draw on linguistic variation to perform aspects of their identities, including their races and ethnicities. This article examines the ways in which race and ethnicity have been traditionally conceptualized in linguistics and allied fields and draws on research from other social sciences to see how they have begun to study individuals who fall outside of traditionally preexisting social categories. The article also briefly discusses the results of one of the first major sociolinguistic studies on multiracially identified participants, which found substantial effects of self-conceptualization and self-identification on linguistic behavior of these participants, a result which informs how future work should consider individuals who identify as two or more races. Finally, it will address future directions for research at the intersection of personal identity, race, and language.},

	doi = {10.1017/s0140525x00044149},
	abstract = {It is hypothesized that Creole languages are largely invented by children and show fundamental similarities, which derive from a biological program for language. The structures of Hawaiian Pidgin and Hawaiian Creole are contrasted, and evidence is provided to show that the latter derived from the former in a single generation. A realistic model of the processes of Creole formation shows how several specific historical and demographic factors interacted to restrict, in varying degrees, the access of pidgin speakers to the dominant language, and hence the nature of input to the children of those speakers. It is shown that the resulting similarities of Creole languages derive from a single grammar with a restricted list of categories and operations. However, grammars of individual Creoles will differ from this grammar to a varying extent: The degree of difference will correlate very closely with the quantity of dominant-language input, which in turn is controlled by extralinguistic factors. Alternative explanations of the above phenomena are surveyed, in particular, substratum theory and monogenesis: Both are found inadequate to account for the facts. Primary acquisition is examined in light of the general hypothesis, and it is suggested that the bioprogram provides a skeletal model of language which the child can then readily convert into the target language. Cases of systematic error and precocious learning provide indirect support for the hypothesis. Some conjectures are made concerning the evolutionary origins of the bioprogram and what study of Creoles and related topics might reveal about language origins.},

The contributions reflect  from various perspectives and using different types of data  on the interplay between structure and variation in contact languages, both synchronically and diachronically. The contributors consider a wide range of languages, including Surinamese creoles, Chinook Jargon, Yiddish, AAVE, Haitian Creole, Afro-Hispanic and Afro-Portuguese varieties, Nigerian Pidgin, Sri Lankan Malay, Papiamentu, and Bahamian Creole English. A need to question and test existing claims regarding pidginization/creolization is evident in all contributions, and the authors provide analyses for a variety of grammatical structures: VO-ordering and affixation, agglutination, negation, TMAs, plural marking, the copula, and serial verb constructions. The volume provides ample evidence for the observation that pidgin/creole studies is today a mature subfield of linguistics which is making important contributions to general linguistic theory.},

The child simultaneous bilingual literature mostly focuses on development in childhood, whereas heritage speakers are often tested at an endstate in adulthood. However, insights from child simultaneous bilingual acquisition must be considered in heritage language acquisition theorizing precisely because many heritage speakers demonstrate the adult outcomes of child simultaneous bilingual acquisition. Data from child simultaneous bilingual acquisition raises serious questions for the construct of incomplete acquisition, a term broadly used in heritage language acquisition studies to describe almost any difference heritage speakers display from baseline controls (usually monolinguals). We offer an epistemological discussion related to incomplete acquisition, highlighting the descriptive and theoretical inaccuracy of the term. We focus our discussion on two of several possible causal factors that contribute to variable competence outcomes in adult heritage speakers: input and formal instruction in the heritage language. We conclude by offering alternative terminology for heritage speaker outcomes.},

Complementary methods of analysis for assessing AAE include a token-based Dialect Density Measure (DDM), a type-based vernacular diversity index, and frequency-based variation analysis. The study reveals different trajectories and peak periods for the use of AAE, including a ‘roller coaster’ and a curvilinear trajectory; at the same time, there is a common dip among speakers in the overall use of vernacular AAE from Grade 1 through Grade 4. Examination of a selective set of demographic and self-regard measures shows no significant differences for gender, school racial density, racial peer contacts, and measures of Afro-centrality, but does show a significant correlation between mothers’ and child use of AAE as well as age/grade.},

The recent (re)discovery of early documents written in creole languages such as Negerhollands, Bajan, and Sranan, allows for a detailed and empirically founded reconstruction of creolization as an historical-linguistic process. In addition, demographic and socio-historical evidence on some of the relevant former colonies, such as Surinam, Haiti, and Martinique, sheds new light on some crucial sociolinguistic aspects of creolization, such as the rate of nativization of the creole-speaking population. Both types of evidence relate to essential questions in the theory of creolization, such as: Is creolization a matter of first or second language acquisition? What are the respective roles of substrate, superstrate, and universal grammar in creole genesis? And, what, if any, are the differences between creole development and normal language change? The subjects discussed in this volume include: a comparative study of the historical development of seven pidgins and creoles (Baker); reflexives in 18th-century Negerhollands (Van der Voort \&amp; Muysken); the emergence of taki as a complementizer in Sranan (Plag); the historical development of relativization in Sranan (Bruyn); the cultural and demographic background of creolization in Haiti and Martinique (Singler); the creole nature of early Bajan (Field); a linguistic analysis of the so-called 'slave letters' in Negerhollands (Stein); and demographic factors in the formation of Sranan (Arends).},

The second issue is whether the alternative methods that previous researchers have used to compute the incidence of “contraction” or “deletion” (“Labov Contraction and Deletion,” “Straight Contraction and Deletion,” “Romaine Contraction”) fundamentally affect the results. We conclude that they do, especially for contraction. We also discuss implications of our analysis for two related issues: the ordering of contraction and deletion in the grammar, and the presence of age-grading or change in progress in East Palo Alto.},

If so, by which linguistic structures are these characterized, and by which extralinguistic conditions have they been brought about? Which are the linguistic mechanisms underlying processes of restructuring, and how did grammaticalization and reanalysis shape the reorganization of linguistic, specifically morphosyntactic structures commonly called creolization? What is the role of language contact, language mixing, substrates and superstrates, or demographic factors in these processes?

Shifting linguistic attention from the model of a monolingual speaker to the model of a multilingual speaker is important for the advancement of our understanding of the language faculty. Native speaker competence is typically the result of normal first language acquisition in an environment where the native language is dominant in various contexts, and learners have extensive and continuous exposure to it and opportunities to use it. Heritage speakers present a different case: they are bilingual speakers of an ethnic or immigrant minority language, whose first language often does not reach native-like attainment in adulthood. We propose a set of connections between heritage language studies and theory construction, underscoring the potential that this population offers for linguistic research. We examine several important grammatical phenomena from the standpoint of their representation in heritage languages, including case, aspect, and other interface phenomena. We discuss how the questions raised by data from heritage speakers could fruitfully shed light on current debates about how language works and how it is acquired under different conditions. We end with a consideration of the potential competing factors that shape a heritage language system in adulthood.},

	abstract = {The evidence which sociolinguists have used in recent discussions of the question of prior creolization in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) comes primarily from recordings made in the 20th century. While such evidence is helpful, we need to go further back in time, examining sociohistorical and textual evidence from the 17th and 18th centuries in which the roots of AAVE were laid down. Demographic and other conditions were most favorable to pidginization and creolization in the Southern colonies, which accounted for 87 percent of American Blacks in the mid-18th century, and especially in South Carolina and Georgia. Additionally, the sociohistorical evidence suggests that pidgin-creole speech may have been brought to America by the large numbers of slaves imported from the West Indies in the formative years of each colony, in New England and the Middle colonies as well as the South. Textual evidence of early creole-like speech in Massachusetts, New York, Maryland and Virginia may well derive from this source.},

	abstract = {"Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork" (HCWR) is a 5-volume, 4766-page collection of folkloric material gathered by Hyatt in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia between 1936 and 1940. Supplementary interviews were conducted in Florida in 1970. The "Hoodoo" collection consists of 13,458 separate magic spells and folkloric beliefs, plus lengthy interviews with professional root doctors, conjures, and hoodoos. All but one of Hyatt's 1600  informants were African-Americans, but several narrations by European-Americans (collected for his earlier book, "Folklore From Adams County, Illinois") were also included. Hyatt recorded the material on Edison cylinders and a device called a Telediphone, often without the full knowledge of the participants. He then transcribed and annotated it for publication. Occasionally his equipment failed or was not available and he took hand-written notes instead. The 1930s field recordings have since been destroyed, with the exception of a few cylinders that Hyatt had pressed onto 78 rpm records. The Florida interviews of 1970, recorded on cassette tapes, have survived. 

As if to overcome the ham-fisted linguistic editing of Negro dialect that marred "Folklore From Adams County Illinois,"  this time Hyatt transcribed the speech of his  informants semi-phonetically. What may look to modern eyes like "racial stereotyping" or making fun of Southerners was actually his sincere attempt to catalogue variant regional pronunciations. If you read several spells, you will see that he did NOT impose upon his  informants one single stereotyped "black dialect" or "Southern dialect" but in fact conveyed, as accurately as he could, the true sound of each person's speech. Reading the spells aloud and noting the location where each  informant lived will help you comprehend this. I do not intend to apologize for Hyatt's technique, and i hope that future scholars will not do so either. 

The publication of this material was accomplished between 1970 and 1978, again  under the imprint "Memoirs of the Alma C. Hyatt Foundation." The first two volumes were issued as a set in 1970, and said to be complete, but then, after a few years,  three more volumes were released.

Prof. Fill showed me extraordinary kindness during my term in Graz as Fulbright guest professor, and I will never forget all that he did to make my stay a pleasant one. Conversations we had, and his work which I have read on ecological linguistics, makes me realize that an ecological linguistic approach would be an insightful way to examine the place of Ebonic in its social setting in the United States; why it differs as much as it does from other kinds of American English, why it does not differ more, and why it is being so robustly maintained. I regret that time has not allowed my to include an ecological perspective in the present article. Another strand of Professor Fill's work, on tension in linguistic systems, contributes what I believe is a key concept in the proper understanding of the distribution of reflexives in various languages, another of area of my research. I am pleased to offer the present work as a token of my appreciation.},

Sensitivity to aspects of speaker agency, attitude, or orientation aligns social network analysis somewhat more closely with the communities of practice model, although social network accounts of groups or communities are generally rather more abstract—referring. A section in this chapter reviews some variationist studies which have employed the network concept, and begins by noting that the effect of interpersonal relationships on language choices has long been explored in sociolinguistics; witness Gauchat's account of variation in the vernacular of the Swiss village of Charmey. It discusses some of the major methods and findings of this research, before reviewing two later studies which take it as a point of departure. The chapter concludes by considering the links between mobility, social network structure, and social class.},

The disregard for her speech in court and the media is familiar to vernacular speakers and puts Linguistics itself on trial: following Saussure, how do we dispel such ‘prejudices’ and ‘fictions’? We show that Jeantel speaks a highly systematic AAVE, with possible Caribbean influence. We also discuss voice quality and other factors that bedeviled her testimony, including dialect unfamiliarity and institutionalized racism. Finally, we suggest strategies for linguists to help vernacular speakers be better heard in courtrooms and beyond.},

Rather than taking for granted existing categories for parsing and classifying race and language, we seek to understand how and why these categories have been co-naturalized, and to imagine their denaturalization as part of a broader structural project of contesting white supremacy. We explore five key components of a raciolinguistic perspective: (i) historical and contemporary colonial co-naturalizations of race and language; (ii) perceptions of racial and linguistic difference; (iii) regimentations of racial and linguistic categories; (iv) racial and linguistic intersections and assemblages; and (v) contestations of racial and linguistic power formations. These foci reflect our investment in developing a careful theorization of various forms of racial and linguistic inequality on the one hand, and our commitment to the imagination and creation of more just societies on the other.

interactions between English-speaking Anglo and monolingual

In directives to Spanish-speaking employees, Anglo managers typically use
English with elements of Mock Spanish. Because the Anglo managers fail to
question whether their limited use of Spanish is sufficient for
communicative success, Spanish speakers are almost always held responsible
for incidents resulting from miscommunication. For Latino workers, Spanish
provides an alternative linguistic market in which Spanish operates as a
form of solidarity and resistance. The competing functions of Spanish
serve to reinforce racial segregation and inequality in the workplace.I am greatly indebted to the restaurant workers

We argue that the quantitative results should be interpreted by considering the complex semiotic links this variable has with respect to non-Asian ethnicities and by considering speakers’ negotiations of their local and cultural identities amidst different (and changing) sociohistorical contexts.

While such verbal behavior probably encompasses most white use of AAVE, it is not the only way in which whites (or other non–blacks) can use the variety. This paper presents a case study of the language of a 23 year old white female who makes consistent use of many distinctive linguistic features associated with AAVE. I argue that the interaction of ideologies of race, class, localness and language allow her to be considered an ingroup member despite her biographical race. This suggests that there is a tension between academic linguistic theory and actual speaker practice in assigning authenticity to individuals, and I conclude that language ideologies and other forms of qualitative evidence should be taken into account by sociolinguists looking at the link between language and race.},

The other cue, syntactic parallelism, codifies the expectation that repairs continue a syntactic category that was left unfinished in the reparandum (Levelt, 1983). The two cues are combined in a Treebank PCFG whose states are split using a few simple tree transformations. Parsing performance on the Switchboard and Fisher corpora suggests that these two cues help to locate speech repairs in a synergistic way.},

	abstract = {Sociolinguists now have more options for collecting speech data than ever before. Informants who might otherwise be inaccessible to the analyst could record themselves using smartphones and personal computers; researchers might also consider YouTube or recordings uploaded to other internet sites as sources of data. However, digital compression techniques simplify some acoustic content and discard others (Bulgin, De Decker \& Nycz 2010) while lower-quality microphones may distort the quality of the signal (Van Son, R.J.J.H. 2005). Therefore, before such data can be used for dialect research, it is crucial to determine if these media affect the reliability of acoustic analyses (Gonzalez, Cervera and Llau 2003; Gonzalez and Cervera 2001). As an initial test, we looked the effect of these devices on representations of the vowel space. Male and female speakers were recorded reading a word list containing 10 English monophthongs in h\_d context using a Roland Edirol R-09 (WAV format) recorder, an Apple iPhone (lossless Apple m4a), a Macbook Pro running Praat 5.1 (WAV) and a Mino Flip video camera (AVI converted to AIFF). The Mino Flip file was then uploaded to Youtube and subsequently downloaded (MP3) for analysis. Speakers read each word 3 times while seated in a quiet room with the recorders placed on a table in front of them. Measurements of F1 through F4 were taken at the temporal midpoint of each vowel using Praat 5.1. Differences between recording formats were tested in R using a Repeated Measures ANOVA with separate runs for each formant (F1-F4). Preliminary results indicate that the Mino and Mino-derived YouTube formats differ substantially from the lossless Edirol recording. F1 values for most vowels were raised in Mino and Youtube measurements. F2 was also affected, such that front vowels were artificially raised while back vowels were lowered. Thus the vowel space is effectively altered with lowering along the F1 dimension and a widening of the space along the F2 dimension. These effects seem to be exaggerated for the female speaker. Based on these results, Macbook Pro and iPhone may be suitable recording options for studying the vowel spaces of speakers. Mino and its Youtube derivative show a number of significant deviations from lossless recordings indicating that audio from these devices should not be used for this type of analysis until corrective measures are identified.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Speech scientists often have to work with speech signals that have been transmitted over the telephone. Although the acoustic properties of telephone transmission such as the band-pass filter characteristics are well known, little attention has been paid to their effect on the measurement of speech parameters.1 This study deals with artefacts introduced by the lower cut-off slope of the transmission channel on vowel formants. For theoretical reasons, frequency components may be assumed to be attenuated the lower they are. Therefore F1 of most vowels can be expected to be affected most. Attenuation of the lower components of a formant will necessarily increase the relative weight of the higher components for the determination of a formant and thus cause an artificial upward shift of its centre frequency. An empirical investigation with directly and telephone-transmitted samples from ten male and ten female subjects shows that the predicted effect on F1 does in fact occur for all tested vowels except /a/, whose F1 is too high to be affected by the slope of the band-pass. The consequences of measurement errors arising from such artefacts are discussed with special reference to speaker identification and empirical dialectology.},

	abstract = {This study analyses the effect of mobile phone transmission on vowel formant frequencies, based on the study presented by Künzel (2001). Six male and six female speakers read a short passage into a mobile phone. Two simultaneous recordings were made, one at the far end of the phone line and the other via a microphone directly in front of the speaker. Measurements of F1, F2 and F3 were taken from between 15 and 25 stressed vowels per speaker in both sets of recordings. Due to the filtering effect of the phone transmission, F1 frequencies for most vowels were found to be higher than their counterparts in the direct recordings. The overall effect of the mobile phone on F1 frequencies was considerably greater than the landline telephone effect found by Künzel (2001): on average the F1 values in the mobile condition were 29 per cent higher than in the direct condition. On the whole F2 measures were not significantly affected, in line with Künzel's findings. F3 frequencies were also generally unaffected by the mobile phone transmission. Exceptions were found, however, particularly for individual speakers with relatively high F3s. In these cases the mobile recordings tended to yield significantly lower values. The consequences of measurement errors arising from the different recording conditions are discussed with reference to forensic speaker identification.},

It builds an acoustic profile from 5507 tokens drawn from interviews with 67 Kansas Citians born between 1955 and 1999. Results reveal a variety of overlap patterns among all five vowels, with the most widespread being overlap between the pre-/l/ allophones of FOOT, STRUT, and GOAT. Acoustically, overlap patterns generally do not show a trend of change in apparent time. However, responses to minimal pairs reveal substantial apparent-time increases in judgments of "close" or "same." Speakers appear to adjust their productions of vowels to match their minimal pair judgments. The interaction of these productions and judgments indicates a different profile for these five vowels than has been observed in other communities and suggests that some of these vowels have become phonemically ambiguous in Kansas City.},

This paper addresses the gap by investigating the stylistic use of falsetto phonation. Focusing on the speech of Heath, a speaker exhibiting considerable cross-situational variation, I show that when attending a barbecue with friends, Heath's falsetto is more frequent, longer, and characterized by higher fundamental frequency (f0) levels and wider f0 ranges. Advancing recent approaches to variation which treat linguistic features as stylistic resources for constructing social meaning, I draw on an analysis of the discourse contexts in which falsetto appears to illustrate that the feature carries expressive connotations. This meaning is employed to construct a ‘diva’ persona and may also participate in building a gay identity.},

"The Dictionary of Smoky Mountain English is the product of more than sixty years' work by the late Joseph S. Hall, a scholar who spent much of his life documenting Smoky Mountain speech and lore beginning in 1937, and Michael B. Montgomery, who assumed editorship of the dictionary in 1990. It is based on hundred of recordings and written sources that date as far back as the late eighteenth century and includes interviews with elderly residents in the 1930s, early church minutes, Civil War letters, local fiction, and written commentaries on mountain speech." "The dictionary is rich in the terminology of traditional mountain culture, illuminating regional practices connected with herbal medicine, moonshining, farming, cooking, music, religious customs, and many other areas. Popular nomenclature for flora and fauna forms a major component of the dictionary. Grammatical forms and patterns are covered in particular detail because they are often hallmarks of southern Appalachian English." "Each entry contains a headword or phrase with variant forms and spellings, one or more definitions, dated citations, and etymology. The volume includes a user's guide and an overview of the grammar, which covers points of usage regarding nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions, prefixes and suffixes, and other grammatical elements of Smoky Mountain speech."--BOOK JACKET.},

It is increasingly common in the sociolinguistic literature for researchers to utilize speech data that was collected over the course of many decades. These kinds of datasets contain three different time dimensions that researchers can utilize to investigate language change: (i) the speakers’ dates of birth, (ii) the speakers’ ages at the time of the recording, and (iii) the date of the recording. Proper investigation of all three time dimensions is crucial for a theoretical understanding of the dynamics of language change. I recommend utilizing two-dimensional tensor product smooths, fit over speakers’ date of birth and the year of the recording, to analyze the contribution of these three time dimensions to linguistic changes. I apply this method to five language changes, based on data drawn from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus. I find relatively weak evidence for lifespan effects in these changes, robust generational effects, and in one case, evidence of a zeitgeist effect.},

However, explicit verbalizations, such as “I haven’t finished” or “Can I say something?” do exist. This paper investigates instances in which participants employ meta formulations to structure their interaction. It describes their forms, sequential locations and interactional relevance. Speakers are found to make meta references to turn beginnings, both their own and those of others, and turn completions, typically by others. Meta turn-taking actions are used as a last resort, after other, implicit turn-taking strategies have failed; as a strategy to secure turn space; as a way of eliciting specific next actions; as a practice for initiating repair; and as a more general strategy for committing to a specific course of action.},

We use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the dynamic properties of these network roles in a large social influence network, in which diffusion is modeled as the probabilistic uptake of one of several competing variants by agents of unequal social standing. We find that highly-connected agents, structural equivalents of leaders in empirical studies, advance on-going change by spreading competing variants. Isolated agents, or loners, holding on to existing variants are safe-keepers of variants considered old or new depending on the current state of the rest of the population. Innovations spread following a variety of S-curves and stabilize as norms in the network only if two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: (1) the network comprises extremely highly connected and very isolated agents, and (2) agents are biased to pay proportionally more attention to better connected, or popular, neighbors. These findings reconcile competing models of individual network roles in the selection and propagation process of language change, and support Bloomfield's hypothesis that the spread of linguistic innovations in heterogeneous social networks depend upon communication density and relative prestige.},

There are two selective forces that play a role in determining the critical learning period: (i) having a longer learning period increases the accuracy of language acquisition; (ii) learning is associated with certain costs that affect fitness. As a result, there exists a limited learning period which is evolutionarily stable. This result is obtained analytically by means of a Nash equilibrium analysis of language acquisition devices. Interestingly, the evolutionarily stable learning period does not maximize the average fitness of the population.},

	abstract = {Vibrant online communities are in constant flux. As members join and depart, the interactional norms evolve, stimulating further changes to the membership and its social dynamics. Linguistic change --- in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the norm --- is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates individual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective identity. We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as it happens and for understanding how specific users react to these evolving norms. By applying this framework to two large online communities we show that users follow a determined two-stage lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to linguistic change: a linguistically innovative learning phase in which users adopt the language of the community followed by a conservative phase in which users stop changing and the evolving community norms pass them by. Building on this observation, we show how this framework can be used to detect, early in a user's career, how long she will stay active in the community. Thus, this work has practical significance for those who design and maintain online communities. It also yields new theoretical insights into the evolution of linguistic norms and the complex interplay between community-level and individual-level linguistic change.},

Results show that norms prescribing a particular use of technology are socially constructed over time at the level of locally defined groups and also show that the influence of these norms is limited to the boundaries of the group. It is concluded that the process of social construction is restrained by social identities that become salient over the course of interaction via CMC.

The diffusion networks of these conventions were dense and highly clustered, so no single user was critical to the adoption of the conventions. Despite being invented at different times and having different adoption rates, only two variations came to be widely adopted.

Listeners between 4 and 79 years old in the Midwestern United States heard talkers from the Midland, Northern, Southern, and New England regions in two regional dialect perception tasks: identification and discrimination. The results showed that listeners as young as 4–5 years old understand the identity-marking significance of some regional dialects, although adult-like performance was not achieved until adolescence. Further, the findings suggest that regional dialect perception is simultaneously impacted by the specific dialects involved and the cognitive difficulty of the task.},

Distractors with Dutch names phonologically related to English target names (deksel, ‘lid,’ given target desk) also received longer fixations than distractors with phonologically unrelated names. Again, English listeners showed no differential effect. With the materials translated into Dutch, Dutch listeners showed no activation of the English words (desk, given target deksel).

I focus on the simultaneous interpreting of the pastor's French sermon into English. I argue that the interpreting activity performed at church is used as a powerful interactional device to dramatize and shape the pastor's sermon. A close examination of participant roles shows that although these may appear to be predetermined by the interpretee-interpreter format of the sermon, speaking roles are actually fluid and negotiated. I submit that an important role of the church interpreter is to convey the pastor's inspiration from the Holy Spirit and reach out to the potential audience absent from the here and now of the service. His high emotional engagement helps convey this inspiration prospectively to the audience and retroactively to the pastor himself.},

Investigating transfer in a situation of long-term societal language contact aims to shed light on the emergence of regional French phonological features from contact with Occitan. Using a sociophonetic methodology, the concept of equivalence classification (Flege 1988) is investigated, that is, that L2 words will be (initially) decomposed into familiar L2 sound categories, causing L1 and L2 sounds to resemble each other phonetically. The consequences of language contact are modelled statistically using an original corpus of over 1200 vowel tokens. The findings show that equivalence classification may not lead to equated sounds coming to resemble each other phonetically, suggesting necessary revisions to the speech learning model (SLM) hypothesis, and the need to consider the influence of sociolinguistic factors in situations of long-term language contact is emphasised.},

In the emotional Stroop task, which taps into an automatic early lexical level of processing, the bilingual participants did not display the same automatic level of activation in their second language (L2) as in their first language (L1). In the emotionality-rating task, which involves a later, more in-depth conscious level of processing than the preceding task, similar results were found in both languages spoken by the bilinguals. These findings are interpreted as indicating that late bilinguals do not automatically respond to the emotional arousal associated with the meanings of L2 words to the same extent as in the L1, and this is likely to be mediated by language proficiency and the context in which the language is learned.},

No differences between native and non-native speakers in their behavioural responses were present: the pattern of interference from negative and taboo words was found to be identical in L1 and L2. SCLs, however, did reveal differences between the native and non-native participants: native English speakers responded with significantly higher SCLs to negative and taboo words when compared with neutral and positive words. This difference was not observed in non-native speakers, although there was a trend for taboo words to elicit greater SCLs than positive words.

One prominent instance of this phenomenon is the use of African American English by European American actors in Hollywood films as part of what is argued to be a complex language-based form of blackface minstrelsy. As mock language, linguistic minstrelsy in such films involves sociolinguistic processes of deauthentication, maximizing of intertextual gaps, and indexical regimentation of the performed language, but unlike earlier forms of minstrelsy these performances are typically problematized within the films as transgressions of the ideology of racial essentialism. In the two films analyzed in detail in the article, linguistic minstrelsy is shown both to reproduce and to undermine the symbolic dominance of hegemonic white masculinity.},

The migration of old-urban elites to new-urban areas has been given scant attention in the sociolinguistics of mobility. This article examines language ideologies of differentiation that emerged from the migration of Morocco's bona fide old-urban elite from the city of Fez (the Fessis) to the new metropolis of Casablanca. This understudied sociolinguistic encounter brings into sharp focus two quintessential old-urban and new-urban varieties of Arabic along with their complex indexical system that links linguistic forms to identities, lifestyles, and moralities. Based on ethnography and discourse analysis of interviews with two women of Fessi extraction in Casablanca (a migrant and a local-born), I provide an in-depth account of what sounding Fessi means and accomplishes--and fails to accomplish--for these women, showing in the process the (re)production and change of language ideologies. The article demonstrates how changes in indexicalities relate to ongoing group boundary reconfiguration and to processes of linguistic (non)accommodation.

This study investigates how linguistic variation carries social meaning, examining the impact of the English variable (ING) on perceptions of eight speakers from the U.S. West Coast and South. Thirty-two excerpts of spontaneous speech were digitally manipulated to vary only in tokens of (ING) and used to collect listener perceptions in group interviews (N = 55) and an experiment (N = 124). Interview data and experimental results show that (ING) impacts social perception variably, inhabiting an indexical field of related meanings (Eckert, Penelope. [2008]. Variation and the indexical field. Journal of Sociolinguistics 12(4):453-476). One of these meanings, intelligence/education, is explored in detail to understand how a given meaning is realized or not in a specific context. Speakers were heard as less educated/intelligent when they used -in, but this effect is driven by reactions to speakers heard as aregional and not as working-class. Some implications on our future understanding of the processing of socially laden variation are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This situation offers an ideal opportunity to examine the dynamics of new dialect formation in progress, and the extent to which speakers acquire local dialect traits as they learn English as a second language. We focus on the production of the /ai/diphthong among adolescents in two emerging Hispanic communities, one in an urban and one in a rural context. Though both English and Spanish have the diphthong /ai/, the Southern regional variant of the benchmark local dialect norm is unglided, thus providing a local dialect alternative. The instrumental analysis of /ai/ shows that there is not pervasive accommodation to the local norm by Hispanic speakers learning English. There is, however, gradient, incremental adjustment of the /ai/, and individual speakers who adopt local cultural values may accommodate to the local dialect pattern.},

A methodologically coherent analysis reveals that the ‘classic factors’ ( Tagliamonte and D’Arcy 2007 : 203) grammatical person and content of the quote, as well as the effect of mimesis, are transferred to the receptor variety, albeit with varying degrees of completeness. Other conditioning factors are particularized to the local system into which be like is adopted, which leads us to define its spread as a case of weak transfer. We suggest that there are at least two explanations for this finding: (1) global innovations must be considered in light of the local systems into which they are adopted; and (2) the form and amount of contact must be correlated with respect to the knowledge transfer they allow.},

There were no consistent patterns of gender or social class variation in their use, but a clear social class difference in the use of certain forms, with and that favoured by the working-class speakers and and stuff and and things preferred by the middle-class adolescents. The most frequent forms were analysed in terms of phonetic reduction, decategorisation, semantic change and pragmatic shift, changes that together make up the process of grammaticalisation. And that and and everything were the most grammaticalised, followed by or something, with and stuff and and things lagging behind. The multifunctionality of the general extenders caused problems for a rigorous analysis of their pragmatic functions. The paper argues that we must consider their functions within the local contexts in which they occur, to take account of their interaction with other linguistic forms. It is also important to avoid generalising about their functions and, instead, to prioritise the fact that as pragmatic particles they are multifunctional. In this data the general extenders had functions in every communicative domain, often simultaneously. The implications for the quantitative analysis of discourse forms are also considered.},

In this study I compare data from Southern Brazil on the use of a gente in the 1970s and the 1990s. Quantitative analyses are conducted in terms of two methodological approaches: apparent-time and real-time studies. In the real-time analysis, two kinds of studies are discussed: a trend study, with two comparable groups of speakers, and a panel study, with the same speakers compared longitudinally. The linguistic and social embedding of this process is discussed in terms of the Labovian classification of changes as being "from above" or "from below." [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This article reports the findings of parallel studies of variable subject presence in two closely related sign language varieties, Australian Sign Language (Auslan) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). The studies expand upon research in American Sign Language (ASL) (Wulf, Dudis, Bayley, \& Lucas, 2002) that found subject pronouns with noninflecting verbs to be more frequently unexpressed than expressed. The ASL study reported that null subject use correlates with both social and linguistic factors, the strongest of which is referential congruence with an antecedent in a preceding clause. Findings from the Auslan and NZSL studies also indicated that chains of reference play a stronger role in subject presence than either morphological factors (e.g., verb type), or social factors of age, gender, ethnicity, and language background. Overall results are consistent with the view that this feature of syntactic variation may be better accounted for in terms of information structure than sociolinguistic effects.

Although the distribution patterns of /r/ remain the same as for the two previous studies in terms of stylistic, social, and phonological variables (word-final vs. preobstruent), there have been significant increases in the overall percentages by some 10 to 20 percent, and there are important differences in terms of the age distribution: the 2009 study suggests that lower-middle-class younger speakers use the [r]-less variant considerably less than older speakers, contrary to Labov’s original survey. In addition, although African American informants use less word-final /r/ than whites, especially in preobstruent position, they nevertheless follow the general pattern of stylistic and social differentiation according to the store, suggesting that African Americans are moving toward greater integration within the New York City speech community.},

However, the mechanisms that support this remarkable achievement remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that infants use language-control mechanisms to preferentially activate the currently heard language during listening. In a naturalistic eye-tracking procedure, bilingual infants were more accurate at recognizing objects labeled in same-language sentences (“Find the dog!”) than in switched-language sentences (“Find the chien!”). Measurements of infants’ pupil size over time indicated that this resulted from increased cognitive load during language switches. However, language switches did not always engender processing difficulties: the switch cost was reduced or eliminated when the switch was from the nondominant to the dominant language, and when it crossed a sentence boundary. Adults showed the same patterns of performance as infants, even though target words were simple and highly familiar. Our results provide striking evidence from infancy to adulthood that bilinguals monitor their languages for efficient comprehension. Everyday practice controlling two languages during listening is likely to explain previously observed bilingual cognitive advantages across the lifespan.},

Through close analysis of slang-in-use and particularly of the metapragmatic discussions such uses inspired, this article examines how the teens specified relationships between language, race, age, region and class, while achieving multiple social purposes, such as identifying with African Americans, marking urban youth subcultural participation, and interactionally positioning themselves and others as teachers and students of slang. As slang emerged with local linguistic capital, the teens used slang to create social boundaries not only between teens and adults, but also between each other. The discursive salience of region implicitly indexed socio-economic status and proximity to African Americans as markers that teens drew on to authenticate themselves and others as slang speakers.},

The evidence comes primarily from surveys, interviews, and laboratory studies. Studies of bilingual codeswitching (CS) and emotion tend to focus on perception and recollection of experience rather than actual language data. This article uses data from domestic migrant-worker returnee narratives to explore the use of CS in storytelling. Domestic-worker returnees in Indonesia participated in sharing sessions in which they talked about the trauma they experienced while they worked overseas as domestic helpers. CS was widely used and, through a discourse analysis of selected excerpts, the article shows that CS is used for addressee specification and emotional alignment. The article concludes by considering how researchers may use the trauma narratives of repressed groups for social activism.

We provide experimental evidence that this asymmetry is due to phonetic differences in the realisation of word-final [n] in English and French, and, consequently, to the way in which English and French word-final [n] are perceived by native speakers of Japanese. Specifically, French but not English word-final [n] has a strong vocalic release that Japanese listeners perceive as their native vowel [ui]. We propose a psycholinguistic model in which most loanword adaptations originate in perceptual assimilation, a process which takes place during perception and which maps non-native sounds and sound structures onto the phonetically closest native ones. We compare our model to alternatives couched within phonological theory.},

The children's dominant vs. nondominant languages elicited different patterns of neural activity in the lateral asymmetry of an early positive component (P100), and the latencies and distributions of ERP differences to known vs. unknown words from 200–400 and 400–600 ms. ERP effects also differed for ‘high’ and ‘low’ vocabulary groups based on total conceptual vocabulary scores.

Researchers are therefore beginning to see the importance of combining traditional L2 research methods with those that capture the moment-by-moment interpretation of the target language, such as eye-tracking. The major benefit of the eye-tracking method is that it can tap into real-time (or online) comprehension processes during the uninterrupted processing of the input, and thus, the data can be compared to those elicited by other, more metalinguistic tasks to offer a broader picture of language acquisition and processing. In this article, we present an overview of the eye-tracking technique and illustrate the method with L2 studies that show how eye-tracking data can be used to (a) investigate language-related topics and (b) inform key debates in the fields of L2 acquisition and L2 processing.

Twenty-eight advanced learners of English read English texts that contained 12 targets for incidental word learning. The target was a known word (control condition), a matched pseudoword, or that pseudoword preceded or followed by the known word (with the latter being a cue to the pseudoword's meaning). Participants' eye-fixation durations on the targets during reading served as a measure of the amount of attention paid (see Rayner, 2009).
Results indicate that participants spent more time processing the unknown pseudowords than their matched controls. The longer participants looked at a pseudoword during reading, the more likely they were to recognize that word in an unannounced vocabulary posttest. Finally, the known, appositive cues were fixated longer when they followed the pseudowords than when they preceded them; however, their presence did not lead to higher retention of the pseudowords.
We discuss how eye-tracking may add to existing methodologies for studying attention and noticing (Schmidt, 1990) in SLA. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

So what do we do under these conditions of uncertainty? Because relatively proficient L2 speakers have access to the grammar and lexicon of each language when comprehending words and sentences or when planning spoken utterances, and because the recent research suggests that these linguistic systems are not entirely independent, there is a critical question about how the knowledge of two languages affects basic aspects of language processing. In this article, I review how eye-tracking methodology has been used as a tool to address this question. I begin by discussing why eye movements are a useful methodology in language processing research, and I provide a description of one experimental paradigm developed to explore eye movements during reading. Second, I present recent developments in the use of eye tracking to study L2 spoken-language comprehension. I also highlight the importance of using multiple measures of online sentence processing by discussing results obtained using a moving window task and eye-tracking records while L2 speakers read syntactically ambiguous relative clauses. Next, I discuss research investigating syntactic processing when L2 speakers process mixed language. I end with suggestions for future research directions.},

We acoustically analyze the fronting of the back vowels boot and boat, the raising of ban and backing of bat, and the merger of bot and bought, in sociolinguistic interviews with 30 white lifelong residents. Results reveal a change in apparent time for all analyzed variables, indicating the CVS's progression through the community, though not as robust as in urban, coastal areas. Additionally, we provide evidence that shifting patterns for different vowels are structured by the ideological divide between town and country. Thus, as the CVS spreads through Redding, speakers utilize particular features of the shift differently, negotiating identities relevant in California's nonurban locales.},

Taking a historical perspective on workplace multilingualism, it reveals the dynamic relationships between the economic interests and policy-making of an industrial enterprise and the political and sociolinguistic development in a multilingual region, at a time when national authorities introduced assimilation policies. Owned and managed by British industrialists, the mine recruited almost exclusively migrant workers to a remote fjord in the Norwegian periphery, many of them Kven from northern Finland and Sweden. In a multi-layered approach, the study sketches multilingual work practices, policy-making, and the discursive positioning of diversity, and explores the company's management of the relationships between capital, community, and nation-state. It reveals the company's flexible approach towards diversity governed by economic interest. (Workplace multilingualism, mining, Kven, Norway, historical)*},

We show second-generation speakers exhibit a more rigid word order compared to their newly arrived first-generation peers, more often preferring subjects in the preverbal position, and we explain that this increase in word order rigidity among our second-generation can be attributed, in large part, to their increased use of and contact with English. We further posit that the difference in subject placement across generations can be explained by the different context of acquisition since the Spanish that these second-generation speakers are exposed to contains both a higher rate of overt pronouns and a higher rate of preverbal subjects.},

The analyses are based on fieldwork in an Ecuadorian sierra community characterized by ethnic revitalization. Among adult comuneros, the vernacular is seen as an essential part of their Indian cultural heritage. In the children's daily lives, the adults, particularly women and the elderly, speak Quichua among themselves, yet children are not addressed in the vernacular by either parents or elder siblings, and those under 10 years of age are generally more or less monolingual in Spanish. The paradoxical mismatch between ideology and daily practices -- the ethnic revitalization paradox -- is analyzed in light of Quichua speaking practices in intergenerational encounters, and in children's play dialogues. Ultimately, being Quichua means something different to members of each generation.},

This indexical function of variation can contribute to the advancement of ongoing linguistic change. Style shifting in individual sociolinguistic interviews is an indirect indication of social meaning, but the clearest demonstrations are found in studies of speakers in a range of social contexts. We explore and clarify the nature of social meaning in variation, and its relation to linguistic change. Phonological variables are most readily adapted to convey social meaning by their frequency, flexibility and freedom from referential functions. After providing several kinds of evidence of social meaning in phonological variation, we argue that meaning accrues specifically to concrete sounds – to phonetic elements – and not to the phonological structures in which those sounds participate. Mergers, near mergers, splits, chain shifts and parallel shifts are not generally objects of social perception, conscious or unconscious, and are motivated by more abstract principles of change.},

	abstract = {This dissertation explores the evolution of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) during this century in a rural Southern community, here called "Springville," Texas, by investigating the distribution of invariant be, copula deletion, the loss of third person verbal -s, and the use of had + past as a simple past form in the speech of its residents.
The study analyzes tape-recorded data representing several generations of speech in one community and explores the cultural, social, and historical contexts within which that speech has developed. The fieldwork used principally focuses on recordings at sites rather than with individuals, making it possible for fieldworkers to become participant-observers. The recordings are then the natural interactions of community members with each other, rather than with fieldworkers.
The data show a trend towards the acquisition of urban vernacular features for speakers born after World War II. In addition, this dissertation documents real time acquisition of the urban vernacular by reporting on data from a five-year longitudinal study of a Springville child/adolescent. These data suggest that innovations in Springville speech first develop in the city and subsequently spread to the country only as speakers extend and solidify their urban social network ties. The analysis indicates that age-grading is not a plausible explanation for the use of urban vernacular forms; in fact, the data show that as speakers get older they acquire more, not fewer, vernacular features, and use these features more frequently.
Changes in the present and past tense systems documented for Springville speech strongly support Bailey's (1993) hypothesis that demographic shifts in the South, resulting from World War II, have had a dramatic effect on Southern AAVE. The Springville data further suggest that grammatical changes which cluster around World War II, and the continuing changes after the war, provide additional support for the divergence hypothesis.},

The preceding vowel and geographic, ethnic, and age-related differences were found to have strong effects. In comparison to Bostonians, New Hampshire speakers exhibit a higher rate of rhoticity, and fewer factors constrain their variability. Younger speakers are more rhotic than older speakers, as are more educated speakers and those in higher linguistic marketplace positions. This study demonstrates that these patterns fit the transmission (within Boston) and diffusion (to New Hampshire) framework (Labov, 2007) only with the addition of accommodation theory (Niedzielski \& Giles, 1996), which connects our linguistic findings to evidence that many New Hampshire residents do not identify with Boston. The effects on (r) in other studies are compared to determine which effects are particular to individual communities (nonuniversal) and which occur across all communities examined. The nonuniversal effects are therefore available as measures of contact-induced change. This study introduces a method for quantitatively comparing the amount of change between communities.},

A variationist approach to rates of overt pronouns and variable and constraint hierarchies, comparing speakers from different dialect regions (Caribbeans vs. Mainlanders) and different generations (those recently arrived vs. those born and/ or raised in New York), reveals the influence of English on speakers from both regions. In addition, generational changes in constraint hierarchies demonstrate that Caribbeans and Mainlanders are accommodating to one another.

E 69, 026113 (2004)], is modularity maximization. Many heuristics have been proposed for maximizing modularity and yield rapidly near optimal solution or sometimes optimal ones but without a guarantee of optimality. There are few exact algorithms, prominent among which is a paper by Xu et al. [Eur. Phys. J. B 60, 231 (2007)]. Modularity maximization can also be expressed as a clique partitioning problem and the row generation algorithm of Grötschel and Wakabayashi [Math. Program. 45, 59 (1989)] applied. We propose to extend both of these algorithms using the powerful column generation methods for linear and non linear integer programming. Performance of the four resulting algorithms is compared on problems from the literature. Instances with up to 512 entities are solved exactly. Moreover, the computing time of previously solved problems are reduced substantially.},

Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identifies community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular “Louvain algorithm”. The computational efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identifies community structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the highest values found in the literature.},

	abstract = {Uncovering the community structure exhibited by real networks is a crucial step toward an understanding of complex systems that goes beyond the local organization of their constituents. Many algorithms have been proposed so far, but none of them has been subjected to strict tests to evaluate their performance. Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)] and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 7327 (2007); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 1118 (2008)], Blondel et al. [J. Stat. Mech.: Theory Exp. (2008), P10008], and Ronhovde and Nussinov [Phys. Rev. E 80, 016109 (2009)] have an excellent performance, with the additional advantage of low computational complexity, which enables one to analyze large systems.},

The internet proliferation among senior users is also rapidly increasing. In this demographic trend, though younger people’s online activities have heavily been studied, how senior users engage in online activities needs research (Smith 2014) both in the US and Japan. This study specifically examines understudied senior users’ linguistic behavior online from a sociolinguistic perspective (Coupland 2004).This paper is comprised of two parts. Part I makes a quantitative discussion on differences in linguistic and discourse specific features of emoticons between older and younger users for both genders, with respect to their diary-type blogs on everyday topics. Part II makes a qualitative analysis on blogs that discusses a specific topic, moral harassment, and examines how blogging on this particular topic differs from blogging on everyday topics, the latter of which comes from a subset used for the quantitative analyses.The study finds emoticon as the most salient feature that distinguishes younger and older men’s and women’s blogging, and blog topics as a determining factor on emoticon uses.},

Online identity and language use were examined in terms of the disclosure of personal information, sexual identity, emotive features, and semantic themes. Male and female teenagers presented themselves similarly in their blogs, often revealing personal information such as their real names, ages, and locations. Males more so than females used emoticons, employed an active and resolute style of language, and were more likely to present themselves as gay. The results suggest that teenagers stay closer to reality in their online expressions of self than has previously been suggested, and that these explorations involve issues, such as learning about their sexuality, that commonly occur during the adolescent years.},

The interview sample comprised 648 households (408 in Evangeline Parish; 240 in Pointe Coupee Parish) reflecting 3 types of communities: (1) where French was the predominant language, (2) where English was the main language, and (3) where French and English were used fairly equally. The general level of education in both parishes was low by modern standards. Household heads who preferred  to speak French at home averaged significantly fewer years of school. Employed household heads in the French districts were more likely to be farmers than those in mixed or English areas. Both parishes were low-income areas, and French speakers were most often in the low-income group. The French were preponderantly Roman Catholic; the non-French were largely Protestant. The study showed that the process of assimilation was under way at varying speeds and that the French would respond to programs representing economic and educational opportunity. (CM)},

	abstract = {Hundreds of researchers attempted to predict six life outcomes, such as a child’s grade point average and whether a family would be evicted from their home. These researchers used machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, and they drew on a vast dataset that was painstakingly collected by social scientists over 15 y. However, no one made very accurate predictions. For policymakers considering using predictive models in settings such as criminal justice and child-protective services, these results raise a number of concerns. Additionally, researchers must reconcile the idea that they understand life trajectories with the fact that none of the predictions were very accurate., How predictable are life trajectories? We investigated this question with a scientific mass collaboration using the common task method; 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study. Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences.},

Goose fronting is an internal change showing little social differentiation, except before /l/ as in school and pool, where, in contrast to most other dialects of English, goose shows advanced fronting inversely correlated with socioeconomic status. Goat fronting, on the other hand, is a change brought from outside the dialect by the highest status groups, displaying a pattern of monotonic social stratification, a female lead, and a strong effect of ethnicity. The role of attitudes toward the community in the realization of the vowels is compared with the effect of social class construed in terms of distances between social groups. Social class turns out to be a better predictor, suggesting that the role of attitudes and identity may be overestimated in research eschewing a systematic exploration of social class at the same time.},

	abstract = {This study documents changes in the prevalence and evaluation of unstressed vowel devoicing, a salient characteristic of Andean Spanish, in the city of Cusco, Perú following an earthquake in 1950. This event brought city residents into contact with other dialects of Spanish that lack vowel devoicing and also intensified their exposure to the Quechua-accented Spanish of rural migrants, or provincianos, which is characterized by this pronunciation. Results of an attitude-perception study indicate that younger Cusqueñans are aware of devoicing and identify it primarily with the speech of provincianos rather than the Spanish of their city. However, acoustic analysis of interviews conducted with Cusqueñans and provincianos shows that, while the pronunciation is receding from Cusco Spanish, many city natives actually exhibit rates of devoicing similar to those of rural migrants. Cusqueñans’ nearly exclusive association of devoicing with provincianos is attributed to local ideology, including negative attitudes toward rural Andean identity. La presente investigación describe cambios en Ia incidencia y evaluación del ensordecimiento de las vocales átonas, una peculiaridad notable del español andino en Cusco, Perú, durante las décadas posteriores al terremoto que devastó Ia ciudad en 1950. Debido a este acontecimiento, los cusqueños aumentaron su contacto con otros dialectos del español que no exhiben el ensordecimiento vocálico así como con el español de los inmigrantes de zonas rurales, o provincianos, que se caracteriza por este fenómeno fonético. Los resultados de un estudio de actitudes indican que los cusqueños jóvenes son conscientes del ensordecimiento vocálico y lo identifican con el acento de los provincianos pero no lo relacionan con el habla de su propia ciudad. Sin embargo, según el análisis acústico de las entrevistas realizadas a cusqueños y a provincianos, muchos residentes de Ia ciudad siguen empleando esta pronunciación con básicamente Ia misma frecuencia que los provincianos. La asociación del ensordecimiento vocálico con los provincianos, casi exclusiva por parte de los cusqueños jóvenes, es atribuida a actitudes negativas hacia Ia identidad rural andina. [Spanish]},

These middle-aged and older women belong to two social groups which, we argue, constitute two communities of practice within a small black Appalachian community in the Southern United States. From interview data, we analyze six diagnostic sociolinguistic variables (third singular -s absence, copula absence, rhoticity, consonant cluster reduction, habitual be) and also examine productions of /u/ and /o/. The groups differ significantly in their use of the morphosyntactic and syntactic variables and in their vowel productions, but not the consonantal features. Combining our quantitative findings with qualitative data, we suggest language is one of several vehicles the women use to transmit symbolic messages to others and thereby construct identities for themselves and their groups, whose members adhere to different language ideologies, religious norms, notions of feminine decorum, and educational standards.},

This article emphasizes the need for sociolinguistics, especially variationist sociolinguistics, to look beyond strictly local contexts and to go beyond treating variation as located along a linear dimension of standard and vernacular. Based on quantitative analysis of four phonological variables among Chinese professionals in foreign and state-owned companies in Beijing, this study demonstrates that professionals in foreign businesses employ linguistic resources from both local and global sources to construct a new cosmopolitan variety of Mandarin, whereas their counterparts in state-owned businesses favor the use of local features. The study shows that variation does not just reflect existing social categories and social change, but is a resource for constructing those categories and participates in social change.},

Results from a sociolinguistic perception study suggest that at least in some cases, variants of the same variable function independently as loci of indexically linked social meaning. Listener responses were collected to three matched guises of the English variable (ING): -in, -ing, and a neutral guise with no audible (ING) tokens. The results counter the study hypothesis that listener expectation, triggered by speaker regional accent, would shape (ING)'s impact. Instead, the two variants showed distinct social associations: the -ing guises were rated as more intelligent/educated, more articulate, and less likely to be a student than either the -in or neutral guises, which did not differ significantly. In contrast, -in guises made speakers sound less formal and less likely to be gay than the -ing and neutral guises, which did not differ. These results suggest that third-wave work needs to more closely examine the role of the variable in theorizing the relationship between linguistic and social structures.},

This article investigates the social meaning of intonational variation in the speech of three gay professionals. To examine how intonational meanings can be exploited as symbolic resources, this study takes an intraspeaker approach, inspecting declarative intonation patterns across three situations per speaker. The analysis reveals that speakers exhibit systematic patterns of variation on either of two levels—the frequency with which variants are employed or their phonetic manifestations—depending on the salience of variants. The social significance of these patterns is inferred by situating them in their discourse and ethnographic contexts. Importantly, intonational meaning surfaces in both the choice of a variant and its phonetic rendering. The categorical choice of a variant conveys pragmatic meaning, while the variant’s phonetic realization reflects the strength of its social meaning.},

Research has shown how, in the face of this powerlessness, working-class communities turn to group solidarity, and use of the vernacular is seen as part of this more general orientation. As a result, two competing social values—status and solidarity—have featured prominently in discussions around language and class. I expand these discussions using data from a linguistic ethnographic study of children's language in Teesside, England. I argue that meanings related to status and solidarity operate at multiple levels and cannot be taken for granted, and demonstrate that vernacular forms that lack status within the dominant sociolinguistic economy may be used to assert status within local interactional use. I further advance discussion of the ways local vernaculars might be intimately linked to classed subjectivities.

An eye-tracking paradigm is used to examine these associations in early, automatic stages of perception. One group of listeners was told the speaker was from California, while another group was told that the speaker had been described as a Valley Girl. Findings demonstrate that both the California information and the Valley Girl information caused listeners to expect the speaker to exhibit trap-backing. While previous studies have highlighted the influence of macro-sociological categories on linguistic perception, the present study suggests that persona-based social meanings can also serve to influence perception, supporting theories that foreground personae as social constructs crucial to interaction.},

	abstract = {, Abstract:, The structural focus of linguistics has led to a static and modular treatment of meaning. Viewing language as practice allows us to transcend the boundaries of subdisciplines that deal with meaning and to integrate the social indexicality of variation into this larger system. This article presents the expression of social meaning as a continuum of decreasing reference and increasing performativity, with sociolinguistic variation at the performative extreme. The meaning potential of sociolinguistic variables in turn is based in their form and their social source, constituting a cline of ‘interiority’ from variables that index public social facts about the speaker to more internal, personal affective states.},

	abstract = {Despite some well-known problems in its early formulation, Labov's concept of ‘the vernacular’ has enduring relevance in sociolinguistics. This is even more the case if we recast it more abstractly – as ‘vernacularity’, ideologically contrasted with ‘standardness’. Following Labov, class-associated vernacular practices have been a major empirical focus of the discipline; they have also locked in the discipline's political consciousness. The paper traces some different ways in which sociolinguistics has positioned itself in relation to vernacularity. Taking the U.K. as a case in point, the paper then asks how large-scale changes in social class experience may be shifting the bases on which we have defined and researched vernacular language. It considers vernacularisation as a sociolinguistic change running counter to the better-established process of linguistic standardisation.},

Nevertheless, while the restoration of class as a core aspect of sociolinguistic analysis is much welcome, it has also come with its own ideological erasures: the disappearance of colonialism and coloniality. Thus, this paper aims to, first, tackle the general erasure of class in intellectual movements in the humanities and social sciences for the past few decades, then second, demonstrate how such erasure in fact involves the decoupling of class and colonialism through the example of the politics of Englishes in the Philippines, before introducing the concept of colonially induced Unequal Englishes (Tupas, 2015; Tupas \& Salonga, 2016) as a way to address directly such politics.},

The results suggest that the managerial respondents actively discriminate in telephone-based job interviews against applicants speaking Chinese-, Mexican- and Indian-accented English, and all three are rated higher in non-customer-facing jobs than in customer-facing jobs. Job applicants who speak British-accented English, especially men, fare as well as, and at times better than, native candidates who speak American English.

This article addresses this issue by exploring the impact of race on the vocal demands placed on aesthetic labourers. Using raciolinguistics, a field that investigates the interconnections between language and race, the article specifically notes how two sites of language-focused aesthetic labour, English language teaching and Indian call centres, reinforce conceptions of sounding right that privilege Whiteness. A review of the literature from these sites highlights how looking good and sounding right constitute one another. Indeed, while a White body in English language teaching signifies nativeness/clarity in English, Indian call centre agents make themselves look better in the minds of western callers by ‘whitening’ their voices. These examples act as a call to simultaneously examine the racialized body and voice in future aesthetic labour research.},

We examine the possibility that capacity limitations arise from temporal decay; we examine whether they might reflect a limitation in cognitive resources; and we ask whether capacity might be limited because of mutual interference of representations in WM. We evaluate each hypothesis against a common set of findings reflecting the capacity limit: The set-size effect and its modulation by domain-specificity and heterogeneity of the memory set; the effects of unfilled retention intervals and of distractor processing in the retention interval; and the pattern of correlates of WM tests. We conclude that—at least for verbal memoranda—a decay explanation is untenable. A resource-based view remains tenable but has difficulty accommodating several findings. The interference approach has its own set of difficulties but accounts best for the set of findings, and therefore, appears to present the most promising approach for future development.},

	abstract = {In computer vision, virtually every state-of-the-art deep learning system is trained with data augmentation. In text classification, however, data augmentation is less widely practiced because it must be performed before training and risks introducing label noise. We augment the IMDB movie reviews dataset with examples generated by two families of techniques: random token perturbations introduced by Wei and Zou [2019] and backtranslation -- translating to a second language then back to English. In low resource environments, backtranslation generates significant improvement on top of the state of-the-art ULMFit model. A ULMFit model pretrained on wikitext103 and then fine-tuned on only 50 IMDB examples and 500 synthetic examples generated by backtranslation achieves 80.6\% accuracy, an 8.1\% improvement over the augmentation-free baseline with only 9 minutes of additional training time. Random token perturbations do not yield any improvements but incur equivalent computational cost. The benefits of training with backtranslated examples decreases with the size of the available training data. On the full dataset, neither augmentation technique improves upon ULMFit's state of the art performance. We address this by using backtranslations as a form of test time augmentation as well as ensembling ULMFit with other models, and achieve small improvements.},

In such challenging scenarios, recent studies have often used meta-learning to simulate the few-shot task, thus negating implicit common linguistic features across tasks. This paper addresses such problems using meta-learning and unsupervised language models. Our approach is based on the insight that having a good generalization from a few examples relies on both a generic model initialization and an effective strategy for adapting this model to newly arising tasks. We show that our approach is not only simple but also produces a state-of-the-art performance on a well-studied sentiment classification dataset. It can thus be further suggested that pretraining could be a promising solution for few-shot learning of many other NLP tasks. The code and the dataset to replicate the experiments are made available at https://github.com/zxlzr/FewShotNLP.},

By now, efficient and effective algorithms based on character n-grams are in use, mainly with identification based on Markov models or on character n-gram profiles. In this paper we investigate the limitations of these approaches when applied to real-world web pages. The challenges to be overcome include language identification on very short texts, correctly handling texts of unknown language and texts comprised of multiple languages. We propose and evaluate a new method, which constructs language models based on word relevance and addresses these limitations. We also extend our method to allow us to efficiently and automatically segment the input text into blocks of individual languages, in case of multiple-language documents.},

That interpretation can further participate in comprehension and in lexical processing and is vital for relating the sentence to the prior discourse. Our theory offers a unified account of the processing of literal sentences, metaphoric sentences, and sentences containing semantic illusions. It also explains how text can prime lexical access. We show that word literality is a matter of degree and that the speed and quality of comprehension depend both on how similar words are to their antecedents in the preceding text and how salient the sentence is with respect to the preceding text. Interpretation-based processing also reconciles superficially contradictory findings about the difference in processing times for metaphors and literals. The theory has been implemented in ACT-R [Anderson and Lebiere, The Atomic Components of Thought, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, Mahwah, NJ, 1998].},

However, the extent to which stylistic variation may affect these analyses remains largely unexplored. In this paper, I explore how authors use variant spellings stylistically to deploy personae and characterological figures (Agha, 2003), by examining the presence of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) features in a corpus of 15,804 tweets extracted from the timelines of 10 gay British men. I argue that the stylization of AAVE signals the development of a very specific persona—the “Sassy Queen”—which relies on an essentialized imagining of Black women as “fierce” and “sassy.” Concluding, I emphasize the value of micro-level analyses in complementing quantitative analyses of linguistic variation in social media.},

The difference between perplexity estimates from two neural language models (LMs) - one trained on transcripts of speech produced by healthy participants and the other trained on transcripts from patients with dementia - as a single feature for diagnostic classification of unseen transcripts has been shown to produce state-of-the-art performance. However, little is known about why this approach is effective, and on account of the lack of case/control matching in the most widely-used evaluation set of transcripts (DementiaBank), it is unclear if these approaches are truly diagnostic, or are sensitive to other variables. In this paper, we interrogate neural LMs trained on participants with and without dementia using synthetic narratives previously developed to simulate progressive semantic dementia by manipulating lexical frequency. We find that perplexity of neural LMs is strongly and differentially associated with lexical frequency, and that a mixture model resulting from interpolating control and dementia LMs improves upon the current state-of-the-art for models trained on transcript text exclusively.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

This problem can be divided into how to align two transcripts and how to quantify alignment gap. In this paper, we introduce a method of similarity calculation using phone-based or phoneme-based acoustic models trained with the algorithm used to develop Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Use of acoustic models will introduce an issue of speaker dependency because speech spectrums always convey the information of the training speakers’ age and gender, which is totally irrelevant to phonetic similarity calculation. We examine how independent our method is of training speakers and how close the calculated similarity is to the similarity subjectively rated through a listening test. We also compare our method to recent works and show our method can give higher correlation by 4 points to human-rated similarity.},

However, despite the enormous potential presented by this remarkable data source, we still do not have an understanding of the Twitter population itself: Who are the Twitter users? How representative of the overall population are they? In this paper, we take the ﬁrst steps towards answering these questions by analyzing data on a set of Twitter users representing over 1\% of the U.S. population. We develop techniques that allow us to compare the Twitter population to the U.S. population along three axes (geography, gender, and race/ethnicity), and ﬁnd that the Twitter population is a highly non-uniform sample of the population.},

Meta-data data routinely collected through the Collaborative Social Media Observatory (COSMOS: http://www.cosmosproject.net/) relating to UK Twitter users is matched with the occupational lookup tables between job and social class provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) using SOC2010. Using expert human validation, the validity and reliability of the automated matching process is critically assessed and a prospective class distribution of UK Twitter users is offered with 2011 Census baseline comparisons. The pattern matching rules for identifying age are explained and enacted following a discussion on how to minimise false positives. The age distribution of Twitter users, as identified using the tool, is presented alongside the age distribution of the UK population from the 2011 Census. The automated occupation detection tool reliably identifies certain occupational groups, such as professionals, for which job titles cannot be confused with hobbies or are used in common parlance within alternative contexts. An alternative explanation on the prevalence of hobbies is that the creative sector is overrepresented on Twitter compared to 2011 Census data. The age detection tool illustrates the youthfulness of Twitter users compared to the general UK population as of the 2011 Census according to proportions, but projections demonstrate that there is still potentially a large number of older platform users. It is possible to detect “signatures” of both occupation and age from Twitter meta-data with varying degrees of accuracy (particularly dependent on occupational groups) but further confirmatory work is needed.},

The adverbs represent a speaker's subjective commitment to the truth of the proposition represented by the adverb, which is incompatible with the falsity of the same proposition required by negation. This also accounts for the usual unacceptability of SpOAs in other contexts, such as questions and conditionals. The analysis extends to other contexts where SpOAs are acceptable, such as negative questions and negative counterfactual conditionals, in such a way as to contribute support for Giannakidou's (non) veridical theory of polarity over "strengthening" theories based on scalar implicatures. It is also shown that SpOAs' underlying semantic property of being subjective also helps predict their linear order with respect to each other.},

We then map the origin and spread of each of these words. Based on these results, we identify five main regional patterns of lexical innovation on American Twitter, primarily associated with the West Coast, the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, the Deep South, and the Gulf Coast. We conclude by proposing explanations for these results and by discussing their significance to theories of language variation and change, including both the actuation and diffusion of lexical innovations.},

	abstract = {Identification of low-resource data is a traditionally difficult machine learning problem, since the sparsity of available resources prevents classifiers from being adequately trained. An effective way to address the inevitable data sparsity in certain applications, such as in low-resource speech language identification, is transfer learning, which uses the knowledge learned from tasks with large labeled data in settings of limited data. Motivated by the fact that various languages share common phonetic and phonotactic characteristics, we explore transfer learning systems that employ various neural network architectures. We leverage readily available large datasets for creating robust instantiations of language identification models using feed-forward neural networks. These are further fine-tuned on the low-resource data from a target domain to improve the system performance. We apply the proposed approach to the automatic identification of African languages, which comprises a challenging task due to the low-resource data from such languages. We conduct our experiments using two publicly available datasets: the VoxForge corpus which contains 7 Indo-European languages as source data, and the Lwazi corpus which includes 11 African languages as target data. Our results indicate the effectiveness of transfer learning for the identification of low-resource languages from speech signals.},

Unfortunately, most of languages in the world have very limited accumulation of data resources, which result in limited performance on most languages. In this study, two approaches are investigated to deal with the LID task on low-resource languages. The first approach is data augmentation, which enlarges the data set by incorporating various distortions into the original data; and the second approach is multi-lingual bottleneck feature extraction, which extracts multiple sets of bottleneck features (BNF) based on speech recognition systems of multiple languages. Experiments conducted on both the i-vector and x-vector models demonstrated that the two approach are effective, and can obtain promising results on both in-domain data and out-of-domain data.},

This paper investigates how bilinguals realign to the requirements of communication within the context of modern technology by using a “mixed code”. It is based on a linguistic analysis of 40 ICQ histories (24490 lines, 197579 words) which have been collected from 21 tertiary students in Hong Kong. Most ICQ histories (95\%) were written in an admixture of English and Chinese both at intersentential and intrasentential levels. Findings suggest a multileveled functional complementarity between Chinese and English in ICQ texts. There are the typical functional differences between written and spoken language, but at the same time the frequent Chinese-English switch suggests that this is bilinguals' most effective way of managing the pressure to achieve specific purposes in on-line, real time communication. Particular elements of one language are blended with those of the other to serve various functions, that is, the two languages complement each other functionally. The results pose a challenge to our understanding of emerging language forms and functions.},

The first goal of this study is to describe the patterns of Chinese-English code-switched language in 200 blog entries written by 20 Macao young people and the second goal is to use language, computer and social contexts in order to analyze the possible motivations behind the code-switching behaviour of these bloggers. As a result of this study, it is discovered that although the Chinese-English code-switched language in blogs is largely an extension of language used in spoken interactions or written press, there are still some distinctive features which set it apart from the code-switched language used in other genres. In addition the study also reveals that linguistic motivations play a significant role in bringing about Chinese-English code-switching in personal blogs, while computer-related motivations for code-switching are also considered important by some bloggers.},

In designing a polyglot TTS system capable of handling SMS messages within the local context, it was necessary to come up with a pre-processing mechanism for identifying the language of origin of individual word tokens. Given that certain common words can be interlingually ambiguous and that the domain under consideration is both open and subject to containing various word contractions and spelling mistakes, the task is not as straightforward as it may seem at ﬁrst. In this paper we discuss a language neutral language identiﬁcation approach capable of handling the characteristics of the domain in a robust fashion.},

The use of mixup further improves performance of all text based augmentations and reduces the effects of overfitting on a tested deep learning model. Round-trip translation with a translation service proves to be harder to use due to cost and as such is less accessible for both normal and low resource use-cases.},

Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.},

Furthermore, we compare LDR with two reference distributed representation models. Experimental results show competitive performance while dramatically reducing the dimensionality—and increasing the big data suitability—to only 6 features per variety.

	abstract = {The written form of the Arabic language, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs in a non-trivial manner from the various spoken regional dialects of Arabic—the true “native languages” of Arabic speakers. Those dialects, in turn, differ quite a bit from each other. However, due to MSA's prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic data sets have predominantly MSA content. In this article, we describe the creation of a novel Arabic resource with dialect annotations. We have created a large monolingual data set rich in dialectal Arabic content called the Arabic On-line Commentary Data set (Zaidan and Callison-Burch 2011). We describe our annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each of more than 100,000 sentences from the data set by crowdsourcing the annotation task, and delve into interesting annotator behaviors (like over-identification of one's own dialect). Using this new annotated data set, we consider the task of Arabic dialect identification: Given the word sequence forming an Arabic sentence, determine the variety of Arabic in which it is written. We use the data to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for dialect identification, and establish that classifiers using dialectal data significantly and dramatically outperform baselines that use MSA-only data, achieving near-human classification accuracy. Finally, we apply our classifiers to discover dialectical data from a large Web crawl consisting of 3.5 million pages mined from on-line Arabic newspapers.},

This paper presents the first results on a fine-grained dialect classification task covering 25 specific cities from across the Arab World, in addition to Standard Arabic – a very challenging task. We build several classification systems and explore a large space of features. Our results show that we can identify the exact city of a speaker at an accuracy of 67.9\% for sentences with an average length of 7 words (a 9\% relative error reduction over the state-of-the-art technique for Arabic dialect identification) and reach more than 90\% when we consider 16 words. We also report on additional insights from a data analysis of similarity and difference across Arabic dialects.},

	abstract = {À partir d’une conception dynamique et plurielle des émotions, cette thèse propose une réflexion sur l'inscription discursive des affects dans les interactions numériques de type WhatsApp. Elle s'inscrit dans le domaine de l’analyse du discours en interaction (Kerbrat-Orecchioni, 2005) en faisant dialoguer le cadre du discours numérique (Paveau, 2017) avec les propositions théoriques des sciences de l'information et la communication (Allard, 2017). Si les linguistes ont longtemps souligné l’infinité des marques langagières des émotions (Kerbrat-Orecchioni, 2000) voire même leurs hétérogénéités (Plantin, 2011 ; Micheli, 2014), ce postulat est encore plus attesté dans les écosystèmes numériques où l’expression des affects se trouve distribuée dans toute l’interface numérique intégrant indifféremment les mots et les gestes (Jeanneret et Souchier, 1999). Suite à une réflexion méthodologique autour de la constitution du corpus numérique WhatsApp, ce travail porte sur les ressources sémiotiques et discursives dans l’expression des émotions. Ces dernières se voient matérialisées dans de nouvelles formes verbales comme les émotimots lol et mdr, entendus comme un sociolecte de l'affect. Mais dans le cadre des messageries numériques, l’expression des émotions dépassent le verbal pour s’incarner dans des formes l’iconique marquées les photodiscours, où la capture photographique se tisse avec le verbal pour co-construire le sens. À partir d’analyses qualitatives des observables prélevés, cette thèse montre comment les locuteurs et locutrices renouvellent sans cesses les formes d’expression des émotions et comment ils et elles composent avec les affordances numériques du système, pour explorer des versions inédites dans la gestion interactionnelle des affects.},

Determining the extent to which the target audience (e.g., age groups) was reached is critical to evaluating the impact of social media education campaigns. The main objective of this study was to examine the separate and joint predictive validity of linguistic and metadata features in predicting the age of Twitter users. We created a labeled dataset of Twitter users across different age groups (youth, young adults, adults) by collecting publicly available birthday announcement tweets using the Twitter Search application programming interface. We manually reviewed results and, for each age-labeled handle, collected the 200 most recent publicly available tweets and user handles’ metadata. The labeled data were split into training and test datasets. We created separate models to examine the predictive validity of language features only, metadata features only, language and metadata features, and words/phrases from another age-validated dataset. We estimated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 metrics for each model. An L1-regularized logistic regression model was conducted for each age group, and predicted probabilities between the training and test sets were compared for each age group. Cohen’s d effect sizes were calculated to examine the relative importance of significant features. Models containing both Tweet language features and metadata features performed the best (74\% precision, 74\% recall, 74\% F1) while the model containing only Twitter metadata features were least accurate (58\% precision, 60\% recall, and 57\% F1 score). Top predictive features included use of terms such as “school” for youth and “college” for young adults. Overall, it was more challenging to predict older adults accurately. These results suggest that examining linguistic and Twitter metadata features to predict youth and young adult Twitter users may be helpful for informing public health surveillance and evaluation research.},

Geo-tagged Twitter data offers an unprecedented database with rich linguistic representation of fine spatiotemporal resolution and continuity. From the one-year Twitter corpus, we extract lexical characteristics for twitter users by summarizing the frequencies of a set of lexical alternations that each user has used. We spatially aggregate and smooth each lexical characteristic to derive county-based linguistic variables, from which orthogonal dimensions are extracted using the principal component analysis (PCA). Finally a regionalization method is used to discover hierarchical dialect regions using the PCA components. The regionalization results reveal interesting linguistic regional variations in the U.S. The discovered regions not only confirm past research findings in the literature but also provide new insights and a more detailed understanding of very recent linguistic patterns in the U.S.},

	abstract = {This thesis reports a study using a corpus of text messages in English (CorTxt) to explore linguistic features which define texting as a language variety. It focuses on how the language of texting, Txt, is shaped by texters actively fulfilling interpersonal goals. The thesis starts with an overview of the literature on texting, which indicates the need for thorough linguistic investigation of Txt based on a large dataset. It then places texting within the tradition of research into the speech-writing continuum, which highlights limitations of focusing on mode at the expense of other user-variables. The thesis also argues the need for inductive investigation alongside the quantitative corpus-based frameworks that dominate the field. A number of studies are then reported which explore the unconventional nature of Txt. Firstly, drawing on the argument that respelling constitutes a meaning-making resource, spelling variants are retrieved using word-frequency lists and categorised according to form and function. Secondly, identification of everyday creativity in CorTxt challenges studies focusing solely on spelling as a creative resource, and suggests that creativity plays an important role in texting because of, rather than despite, physical constraints. Thirdly, word frequency analysis suggests that the distinct order of the most frequent words in CorTxt can be explained with reference to the frequent phrases in which they occur. Finally, application of a spoken grammar model reveals similarities and differences between spoken and texted interaction. The distinct strands of investigation highlight, on the one hand, the extent to which texting differs from speech and, on the other, the role of user agency, awareness and choice in shaping Txt. The argument is made that this can be explained through performativity and, in particular, the observation that texters perform brevity, speech-like informality and group deviance in construing identities through Txt.},

In doing so, this study reports on keystroke-logging analysis (see Leijten \&amp; Van Waes, 2013) in order to observe how participants (N = 10) composed text as part of everyday mobile communication for the period of one week, subsequently producing 179,996 individual keystroke log-file records. Participants used LogKey, a virtual keyboard application made exclusively for this study to run on the Android mobile operating system. Analysis of keystroke log-file data suggest that timing processes of composing text-messages may differ as participants messaged with different categories of interlocutors, composed on different communication applications, and composed paralinguistic features—such as variants of Lol and Haha (Thurlow, 2003; Tagg, 2012)—at different turn-taking positions. This evidence suggests that keystroke-logging methods may contribute to understanding of how individuals manage interpersonal relationships in real-time (Laursen, 2005; Spilioti, 2011), and suggests future direction for methodologically studying linguistic performances as part of text-based mobile communication.},

With this in mind, this essay centres around discursive analyses of qualitative data arising from an investigation of 159 older teenagers' use of mobile telephone text-messaging - or SMS (i.e. short-messaging services). In particular, against a backdrop of media commentaries, we examine the linguistic forms and communicative functions in a corpus of 544 participants' actual text-messages. While young people are surely using their mobile phones as a novel, creative means of enhancing and supporting intimate relationships and existing social networks, popular discourses about the linguistic exclusivity and impenetrability of this particular technologically-mediated discourse appear greatly exaggerated. Serving the sociolinguistic 'maxims' of (a) brevity and speed, (b) paralinguistic restitution and (c) phonological approximation, young people's messages are both linguistically unremarkable and communicatively adept.},

Recently, there has been a surge of interest within the computational linguistics (CL) community in the social dimension of language.

We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the relation between language and social identity, language use in social interaction, and multilingual communication. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how the large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge the methods and assumptions used in CL studies. We hope to convey the possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and conclude with a discussion of open challenges.},

The analysis distinguishes between a number of spelling types, which include both representations of spoken language and purely graphemic modifications, and three patterns of spelling usage: spellings as a part of the text's regular features, spelling choices as contextualization cues, and as cues of subcultural positioning. By examining the relations between types and usages of non-standard spellings, the paper demonstrates how young writers creatively use the graphemic resources of their language in order to communicate sociocultural meanings, at the same time constructing an orthographic anti-standard in the restricted field of music-related subcultural discourse.},

The first section, linguistic perspectives, addresses the question of how CMC compares with speaking and writing, and describes its unique structural characteristics. Section two, on social and ethical perspectives, explores conflicts between the interests of groups and those of individual users, including issues of online sex and sexism. In the third section, cross-cultural perspectives, the advantages and risks of using CMC to communicate across cultures are examined in three studies involving users in East Asia, Mexico, and students of ethnically diverse backgrounds in remedial writing classes in the United States. The final section deals with the effects of CMC on group interaction: in a women's studies mailing list, a hierarchically-organized workplace, and a public protest on the Internet against corporate interests.},

The analysis reveals a highly structured relationship between participants' social positions on a channel and the linguistic variants they use. The emerging sociolinguistic relationship is more complex than what is predicted by current sociolinguistic theory for offline interaction, suggesting that sociolinguistic investigation of online interaction, where more detailed and fine-grained information about social contacts can be obtained, may offer unique contributions to the study of language variation and change.},

Such work may be characterized as technologically deterministic, since the technology alone is seen as the determiner of user behavior. In contrast, this study is an ethnographic and discourse analytic examination of an elective community of CMC users in a synchronous Internet forum known as a MUD, or multi-user dimension. I examine ways in which users overcome the limitations of the medium and exploit its affordances for comfortable communication. In an ethnographic background discussion, I survey the historical development of power structures on the MUD, its relationship to other MUDs, and the culture of use. I then focus on the speech community''s linguistic register, the variety of speech adapted to the mediated communication situation. Like other related registers, the register reflects the fact that speakers need to signal their community membership as well as produce economical forms given the medium. I examine routines, conventional vocabulary and abbreviations, syntactic and semantic phenomena, and turn-taking and repair strategies in the register. Because the MUD is programmable, commands may be added which reflect or reinforce the speech habits and culture of the community; competent speakers must also know the commands that produce appropriate linguistic forms. Power structures in the community affect speech innovation; the technically empowered are most influential. Contrary to predictions in the literature, I show turn-size is dynamic, varying according to density of conversation, and usually shorter than in face-to-face speech. Back channels are used regularly to maintain a sense of co-presence, by signaling attention and understanding. Finally, I examine the semantics of utterances produced with the "emote" command, which allows third person descriptions of action. Emoted utterances are often in present tense, used for back channels, greetings, narration of "real life" events, and play actions; they appear related to first person performatives and present tense narration in sports commentary register.

In this naturalistic study, adolescents collected their instant messaging conversations for a 1-week period and then completed a spelling test delivered over instant messaging. We used the conversations to develop a taxonomy of new language use in instant messaging. Short-cuts, including abbreviations, acronyms, and unique spellings were most prevalent in the instant message conversation, followed by pragmatic signals, such use of emoticons, emotion words, and punctuation, and typographical and spelling errors were relatively uncommon. With rare exceptions, notably true spelling errors, spelling ability was not related to use of new language in instant messaging. The taxonomy provides an important tool for investigating new language use and the results provide partial evidence that new language does not have a harmful effect on conventional written language.},

From this perspective, the introduction addresses the following specific topics: 1) the selective nature of orthographic choice; 2) the relational and contrastive meaning of orthographic conventions; 3) the interplay of sameness and difference in the use of orthography to make claims on linguistic and cultural identity; 4) orthography and representational control: writing the self vs. representing others and 5) orthographic esthetics: the role of the visual in the interpretation of the oral.},

Their empirical impacts, however, are undocumented. An experiment sought to determine the effects of three common emoticons on message interpretations. Hypotheses drawn from literature on nonverbal communication reflect several plausible relationships between emoticons and verbal messages. The results indicate that emoticons’ contributions were outweighed by verbal content, but a negativity effect appeared such that any negative message aspect—verbal or graphic—shifts message interpretation in the direction of the negative element.},

In an online community, one such practice is variation in orthography, which includes spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Using a dataset of over two million Instagram posts, we investigate orthographic variation in a community that shares pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) content. We ﬁnd that not only does orthographic variation grow more frequent over time, it also becomes more profound or “deep,” with variants becoming increasingly distant from the original: as, for example, \#anarexyia is more distant than \#anarexia from the original spelling \#anorexia. We ﬁnd that the these changes are driven by newcomers, who adopt the most extreme linguistic practices as they enter the community. Moreover, this behavior correlates with engagement with the community: the newcomers that adopt deeper variant orthography tend to remain active for longer in the community, and posts with deeper variation receive more positive feedback in the form of “likes.” Previous work has linked community membership change with language change, and our work casts this connection in a new light, with newcomers driving an evolving practice rather than adapting to it. We also demonstrate the utility of orthographic variation as a new lens to study sociolinguistic change in online communities, particularly when the change results from an exogenous force such as a content ban.},

We investigate these changes by statistical analysis of a dataset comprising 107 million Twitter messages (authored by 2.7 million unique user accounts). Using a latent vector autoregressive model to aggregate across thousands of words, we identify high-level patterns in diffusion of linguistic change over the United States. Our model is robust to unpredictable changes in Twitter's sampling rate, and provides a probabilistic characterization of the relationship of macro-scale linguistic influence to a set of demographic and geographic predictors. The results of this analysis offer support for prior arguments that focus on geographical proximity and population size. However, demographic similarity – especially with regard to race – plays an even more central role, as cities with similar racial demographics are far more likely to share linguistic influence. Rather than moving towards a single unified “netspeak” dialect, language evolution in computer-mediated communication reproduces existing fault lines in spoken American English.},

Thus the ability to classify latent user attributes, including gender, age, regional origin, and political orientation solely from Twitter user language or similar highly informal content has important applications in advertising, personalization, and recommendation. This paper includes a novel investigation of stacked-SVM-based classification algorithms over a rich set of original features, applied to classifying these four user attributes. It also includes extensive analysis of features and approaches that are effective and not effective in classifying user attributes in Twitter-style informal written genres as distinct from the other primarily spoken genres previously studied in the user-property classification literature. Our models, singly and in ensemble, significantly outperform baseline models in all cases. A detailed analysis of model components and features provides an often entertaining insight into distinctive language-usage variation across gender, age, regional origin and political orientation in modern informal communication.},

	abstract = {This book examines gendered language use in six gay male subcultures: drag queens, radical faeries, bears, circuit boys, barebackers, and leathermen. Within each subculture, unique patterns of language use challenge normative assumptions about gender and sexual identity. Rusty Barrett's analyses of these subcultures emphasize the ways in which gay male constructions of gender are intimately linked to other forms of social difference. In From Drag Queens to Leathermen, Barrett presents an extension of his earlier work among African American drag queens in the 1990s, emphasizing the intersections of race and class in the construction of gender. An analysis of sacred music among radical faeries considers the ways in which expressions of gender are embedded in a broader neo-pagan religious identity. The formation of bear as an identity category (for heavyset and hairy men) in the late 1980s involves the appropriation of linguistic stereotypes of rural Southern masculinity. Among regular attendees of circuit parties, language serves to differentiate gay and straight forms of masculinity. In the early 2000s, barebackers (gay men who eschew condoms) used language to position themselves as rational risk takers with an innate desire for semen. For participants in the International Mr. Leather contest, a disciplined, militaristic masculinity links expressions of patriotism with BDSM sexual practice. In all of these groups, the construction of gendered identity involves combining linguistic forms that would usually not co-occur. These unexpected combinations serve as the foundation for the emergence of unique subcultural expressions of gay male identity, explicated at length in this book.},

              This article reexamines the concept of social network used in variationist sociolinguistics by analyzing network structure in terms of different domains of affiliation that are associated with strong ties and with weak ties found inside and outside a speech community. The study presents the role of these ties in explaining morphosyntactic variation in the expressions that introduce adverbial clauses in the variety of Acadian French spoken in northeastern New Brunswick (Canada). Variable rule analyses show that social network is a more regular predictor of the traditional variants
              comme que, quand que
              , and
              si que
              than other social factors, including social class. Correspondence analysis is used to analyze social network structure on the basis of subjects’ affiliations with different domains. The study suggests that the explanation of sociolinguistic variation needs to include a closer examination of weak ties and that multivariate statistical techniques are appropriate for this kind of study.},

The data are drawn from 190 semistructured sociolinguistic interviews from 2008 to 2017. Six linguistic variables were constructed to measure dialect features associated with southern American English. The results show that workers who are employed in the technology industry display significantly fewer southern dialect features than workers in interactive service work, law, and government. The general movement away from southern American English over time was also more prominent among technology workers. These results suggest that newer and more professional industries display less traditional patterns of southern speech. While the results do not support causal claims, they imply that individuals tend to work in industries that match their linguistic and cultural backgrounds.},

A central puzzle in this relationship is the seeming contradiction between two bodies of evidence: automatic, mechanistic diffusion of linguistic forms through social networks and ideologically mediated choice in uptake of forms. Nearly a century of research has revealed that certain types of network structure facilitate the diffusion of linguistic innovation, but these network structures are always anchored in temporally specific and ideologically mediated cultural norms—for instance, norms of gender, class, and ethnicity. Furthermore, not all linguistic variables diffuse in the same way through these structures; social indexicality has a mediating effect. We review prevailing methodologies, theories, and conclusions of this body of work and look ahead to emerging technological advances and more integrated theoretical approaches.},

Commonsense knowledge also provides background information that enables humans to successfully operate in social situations where such knowledge is typically assumed. Since commonsense consists of information that humans take for granted, gathering it is an extremely difficult task.

Though some slang words are available in existing sentiment lexicons, with new slang being generated with emerging memes, a dedicated lexicon will be useful for researchers and practitioners. To this end, we propose to build a slang sentiment dictionary to aid sentiment analysis.It is laborious and time-consuming to collect a comprehensive list of slang words and label the sentiment polarity. We present an approach to leverage web resources to construct a Slang Sentiment Dictionary (SlangSD) that is easy to expand. SlangSD is publicly available for research purposes. We empirically show the advantages of using SlangSD, the newly-built slang sentiment word dictionary for sentiment classification, and provide examples demonstrating its ease of use with a sentiment analysis system.},

Trump's appeals to rage, malice, and revenge by sketching the rhetorical dimensions of an underlying emotional-moral framework in which victimization, resentment, and revenge are inverted civic virtues. I elaborate on the concept of ressentiment (re-sentiment), a condition in which a subject is addled by rage and envy yet remains impotent, subjugated and unable to act on or adequately express frustration. Though anger and resentment capture part of Trump's affective register, I suggest that ressentiment accounts for the unique intersection where powerful sentiments and self-serving morality are coupled with feelings of powerlessness and ruminations on past injuries. Thus, shifting focus from the rhetoric of resentment to that of ressentiment explains how Trump is able to sustain the affective charge of animus without forfeiting the moral high ground of victimhood to his audience's “oppressors”—Democrats, the press, criminals, immigrants, foreign adversaries, welfare recipients, the Me Too movement, “globalists,” and racial Others.},

One of the most pressing debates concerns the visibility of online interaction (i.e. its locus between the public and private ends of the continuum). Although they exist freely online, networked publics are not public forums. They are governed by both personal and communal norms, and they are networked. This combination of factors gives rise to unique ethical challenges, particularly in the case of Facebook, an accessible and data-rich, yet problematic, research site. This paper reviews the ethical difficulties presented by Facebook, and presents a framework for ethnographic sociolinguistic research that uses this site as a source of data. En tant qu’espace public privilégié pour la création de l’identitéà travers l’écriture, le public ≪réseauté≫ (interconnecté) des sites des médias sociaux présente des possibilités prometteuses et sans précédent pour la recherché en sociolinguistique. Cependant, ces sites soulèvent de nombreuses questions méthodologiques et éthiques qui sont nouvelles, d’où l’émergence de discussions portant sur les mesures éthiques appropriées pour la recherche qui vise les communautés discursives en ligne. Un des débats concerne la visibilité de l’interaction en ligne (c.-à-d. sa place entre les extrémités privée et publique du continuum). Bien qu’ils existent de façon libre en ligne, les réseaux publics ne sont pas des forums publics. Ils sont gouvernés à la fois par des normes personnelles et communautaires, et ils sont interconnectés. Cette combinaison de facteurs donne naissance à des défis éthiques uniques, en particulier dans le cas de Facebook, un site de recherche accessible et riche en données, mais problématique. Cet article passe en revue les difficultés éthiques que Facebook présente, et offre un cadre de travail pour la recherche sociolinguistique ethnographique utilisant ce site comme source de données.

Machine learning methods of recent are being used to successfully detect and filter spam emails. We present a systematic review of some of the popular machine learning based email spam filtering approaches. Our review covers survey of the important concepts, attempts, efficiency, and the research trend in spam filtering. The preliminary discussion in the study background examines the applications of machine learning techniques to the email spam filtering process of the leading internet service providers (ISPs) like Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook emails spam filters. Discussion on general email spam filtering process, and the various efforts by different researchers in combating spam through the use machine learning techniques was done. Our review compares the strengths and drawbacks of existing machine learning approaches and the open research problems in spam filtering. We recommended deep leaning and deep adversarial learning as the future techniques that can effectively handle the menace of spam emails.},

While there is unique public interest in T/V as a sociolinguistic phenomenon, it is a subject that has paradoxically been under-represented in linguistics and sociolinguistics publications produced in France. Much of the research conducted on the topic has been carried out by scholars based in other countries, and this is characterised by a rich variety of disciplinary approaches. T/V in contemporary French is a non-probabilistic phenomenon and is therefore not a sociolinguistic variable, in the Labovian sense. Considering the various senses of ‘markedness’, discussed by Haspelmath (2006), there is a good case for considering T as the unmarked option, rather than V, as has often been suggested. The long-term historical tendency for French to lose many of its inflections suggests that, at some time in the future, it is quite possible that vouvoiement will all but disappear. Yet there is no sign in France at present of a massive and decisive shift away from V.},

An earlier study investigating variation in BSL numeral signs found that younger signers were using a decreasing variety of regionally distinct variants, suggesting that levelling may be taking place. Here, we report findings from a larger investigation looking at regional lexical variants for colours, countries, numbers and UK placenames elicited as part of the BSL Corpus Project. Age, school location and language background were significant predictors of lexical variation, with younger signers using a more levelled variety. This change appears to be happening faster in particular sub-groups of the deaf community (e.g., signers from hearing families). Also, we find that for the names of some UK cities, signers from outside the region use a different sign than those who live in the region.},

Grammar checking is fundamental task in the formal world that validates sentences syntactically as well as semantically. Grammar Checker tool is a prominent tool within language engineering. Our review draws on the till date development of various Natural Language grammar checkers to look at past, present and the future in the present context.

These allow NLG to increase an existing message's persuasiveness. Previous research illustrates key aspects in each of the above mentioned five categories. A research agenda to further study persuasive NLG is developed.

Rates of (h) and (ing) are investigated in the casual speech of sixty-three speakers from a community with Cockney heritage: Debden, Essex. The indexicalities of h-dropping in Debden (signalling Cockney) are superordinate to and incorporate the indexicalities of g-dropping (working-class, “improper”), resulting in an implicational relationship. H-dropping implies g-dropping, but g-dropping can occur independently of h-dropping. This occurs in terms of co-variation at the between-speaker level and clustering effects at the within-speaker level which is measured through a novel approach using the number of phonemes as the denomination of distance. The features’ differing social meaning are also related to rates of change. Young speakers are shifting away from linguistic features which index Cockney heritage (h-dropping; the [-Iŋk] variant of -thing words) in favor of more general, southeastern, working-class norms (g-dropping).},

	abstract = {One of the most salient putative African features of Palenquero, an Afro-Hispanic creole spoken in northern Colombia, is the prenominal plural marker ma. However, plural number is not categorically marked with ma, which alternates with bare forms in plural contexts and also occurs in singular contexts. In a principled sample of noun phrases (n = 1,186) from the spontaneous speech of twenty-seven Palenquero-Spanish bilinguals, the rate of ma (versus zero) is 51\% in plural and 13\% in singular contexts. Singular ma is favored with subjects and specific objects, consistent with an association with definiteness. In plural contexts, where it is robust, selection of ma is favored with specific and generic referents in subject role. This conditioning indicates that plural marking is favored for discourse referential nouns, in accordance with the cross-linguistic generalization that morphological marking tends to appear on instances that approach the prototypical function of a category (Hopper \& Thompson, 1984).},

At an arts-focused high school in the San Francisco Bay Area, the curricular and social practices of students in the technical theatre department centre around manual labour. Ethnographic analysis demonstrates that “tech” constitutes a locally enregistered persona, informed by tech students’ positioning as working-class subjects through their bodily, sartorial, and technological practices. Tech students also produce higher and more rounded variants of LOT, and more velarized productions of /l/, than their non-tech peers, and I suggest that articulatory setting is at play in the cohesive indexicality of these variants. I advocate for the continued exploration of co-occurring sociolinguistic variables which treat the body as a broader stylistic context, and propose that studies of co-occurring features focus on the ideological processes by which combinations of variables come to index thematic styles.},

	abstract = {During conversation, speakers modulate characteristics of their production to match their interlocutors’ characteristics. This behavior is known as alignment. Speakers align at many linguistic levels, including the syntactic, lexical, and phonetic levels. As a result, alignment is often treated as a unitary phenomenon, in which evidence of alignment on one feature is cast as alignment of the entire linguistic level. This experiment investigates whether alignment can occur at some levels but not others, and on some features but not others, within a given dialogue. Participants interacted with two experimenters with highly contrasting acoustic-phonetic and syntactic profiles. The experimenters each described sets of pictures using a consistent acoustic-phonetic and syntactic profile; the participants then described new pictures to each experimenter individually. Alignment was measured as the degree to which subjects matched their current listener’s speech (vs. their non-listener’s) on each of several individual acoustic-phonetic and syntactic features. Additionally, a holistic measure of phonetic alignment was assessed using 323 acoustic-phonetic features analyzed jointly in a machine learning classifier. Although participants did not align on several individual spectral-phonetic or syntactic features, they did align on individual temporal-phonetic features and as measured by the holistic acoustic-phonetic profile. Thus, alignment can simultaneously occur at some levels but not others within a given dialogue, and is not a single phenomenon but rather a constellation of loosely-related effects. These findings suggest that the mechanism underlying alignment is not a primitive, automatic priming mechanism but rather guided by communicative or social factors.},

I explore the usefulness of social networks from three perspectives, investigating whether and how social networks can explain changes in the use of former colonial languages in a post-colonial community; the functions of strong and weak ties in a multilingual community; and the social characteristics of communities in which social network as an analytical tool may have an explanatory force. Methodological and theoretical issues involved with the concept of social network are also scrutinised. With some cautions about the limits to the explanations made possible by network analysis, I conclude that the social network is indeed a valuable and important social variable in sociolinguistic investigations, alongside other factors, such as sex and identity.},

	abstract = {The book presents an analysis of selected domains of morphosyntactic variation in a 250,000 word collection of the Middle English Paston Letters (1421-1503) from a historical sociolinguistic point of view. In the three case studies, two nominal and one verbal variable are described and discussed in detail: the replacement of Old English \&lt; h- \&gt; pronouns by borrowed \&lt; th- \&gt; pronouns, the introduction and spread of the \&lt; wh- \&gt; relativizers, and the spread and routinization of light verb constructions ( take , make , give , have , do plus deverbal noun). While the study aims at a balanced integration of theories and methods from a number of different approaches in sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, typology, and language change, its main focus is social network theory and the role of the linguistic individual in the formation and change of language structures. Questions of individual language use and of deliberate versus unmonitored changes in the (individual) system take center stage and are discussed in the light of social network analysis. Traditional empirical social network analysis is carefully revised. Despite its many merits in present-day sociolinguistics, it often needs to be supplemented by hermeneutic-biographical analyses of the individual speakers' lives when applied to historical data. With this background, common theories and models of language change, such as grammaticalization, paradigmatic pressure, typological alignment, and generational shifts, are illustrated and evaluated from the point of view of single speakers and social groups, and their particular embedding in the speech community through various network structures. The book is of interest to advanced students and researchers in English and general linguistics, Middle English, historical linguistics and language change, corpus linguistics, as well as sociolinguistics.},

Reporting on a large-scale project in the multicultural context of Toronto, we argue for combining emic and etic approaches to social categorization. Focusing on the Chinese and Italian communities, our analysis of two sociolinguistic variables shows that speakers may vary in overall rate, but linguistic conditioning remains largely constant across and within ethnic groups. Whereas there is evidence for language transfer in the first generation, differences between generations suggest that transfer does not persist. Some speakers appear to use overall rates to express ethnic identity. Differences between communities may be explained in terms of different timelines of settlement and visible-minority status.},

Data from 20 young Latino New Yorkers are examined with respect to five variables presenting variants of presumed substrate origin. Results are initially contradictory. Depending on the form of scaling used, NYLE can be seen as only marginally systematic or highly so. The paradox can be resolved in two findings. First, non-substrate factors obscure substrate effects at low frequencies, particularly in variables that tend to relatively low substrate-variant-usage rates. Second, individuals show different degrees of systematicity in variable usage. These findings are neutral about the eventual outcome of NYLE as fitting best a dialect or repertoire model. However, the results further imply that if systematicity is developing in NYLE, then it may follow a pattern of leaders and followers in its organization.},

We examine the use of one Punjabi feature (t-retroflexion) and one British feature (t-glottaling) across three groups: first-generation non-native immigrants and two age groups of second-generation British Asians. Cognitively oriented models predict that non-native features will either be innately blocked (Chambers, 2002) or reallocated by native generations. A socially oriented model allows for more gradual change. Contrary to the cognitive view, the older second generation neither blocks nor clearly reallocates use of t-retroflexion; they closely mirror the first generation's non-native use. However, they simultaneously control nativelike t-glottaling, reflecting a robust bidialectal ability. It is the younger second generation who exhibit focused reallocation in the form and function of t-retroflexion. This 20-year lag corresponds to major changes in demographics and race relations in the community over 5 decades. The study shows that acquisition of the local dialect and retention of exogenous features should be seen as independently constrained rather than as mutually exclusive.},

	abstract = {Although Chinese Americans set up Chinese heritage language schools as early as 1848 to preserve the heritage language and to promote a sense of ethnic identity among their American-born children (Chao, 1997), there is strong evidence that language shift to English is taking place rather rapidly within the Chinese communities across the U.S. Data from the 2006 ACS show that while only 34.1 percent of first generation (i.e. foreign-born) Chinese Americans reported speaking ‘English very well’, the percentages rise dramatically for those who are American-born (i.e. second generation and beyond) or born overseas but arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16 (i.e. the 1.5 generation). 70.4 percent of the 1.5 generation and 93.8 percent of the American-born Chinese Americans reported speaking ‘English very well’. Additionally, only about 27.6 percent of the ABCs were estimated to speak their heritage language at home. Taken together, these estimates suggest that the rate of shift from Chinese to English is accelerating. Jia (2008) finds that even for first generation Chinese Americans, their Chinese language skills continue to decline with increasing English immersion. Rapid language shift to English means that many ABCs speak English as one of their native languages, if not the only one. This raises interesting sociolinguistic questions concerning the characteristics of the English spoken by ABCs and how ABCs utilize varieties of English to construct and negotiate differences with respect to each other and vis-à-vis the larger social structure.},

	abstract = {Social network analysis has proved particularly useful in explaining why speakers in bilingual communities maintain or change their language behavior. Researchers have employed this sociolinguistic tool to investigate language shift and maintenance among longstanding stable bilingual communities. An underlying assumption in this analysis is that language, particularly the first language or mother tongue, is an integral part of collective identities, such as national, ethnic or cultural identities, and that maintenance of language across generations is a key factor to the maintenance of such identities. Certain bilingual communities may maintain this language ideology; however, multilingual communities present a more complex picture of the situation and may thus offer a challenge to the underlying assumptions of social network analysis. This article discusses the application of social network analysis to multilingual communities by taking a point of departure in the Filipino community in Oslo, the capital of Norway, with a view towards understanding linguistic and cultural maintenance. Results from the analyses provide support for the importance of social network in understanding language choice and cultural and linguistic maintenance; however, there were some notable exceptions. In this article we discuss language ideologies and the relationship between language and identity as complementary sources of explanation for language choice and language maintenance in this relatively speaking newly established multilingual community.},

Drawing on sociolinguistic interviews with such bilinguals in Jaffa, we demonstrate that while Palestinians’ use of pharyngeals in Hebrew is commonly perceived as transfer from Arabic, their linguistic and social conditioning does not support a transfer account. Rather, for these speakers, pharyngeals are a socially meaningful resource simultaneously linked to Arab identity and to a rich indexical field in Hebrew. While the pharyngeals pattern linguistically as Hebrew features, our findings illustrate that, from a social meaning perspective, sociolinguistic features need not be unambiguously associated with a single language.},

This article presents linguistic evidence from constraint ranking comparisons of variable nonrhoticity and bought-raising in comparable contemporary samples of NYCE and NOE speakers. Findings demonstrate strikingly similar systems for (r), but dissimilar systems for bought-raising. We examine the results of our analyses in the context of evidence from previous comparisons of NYCE and NOE, concluding that the resemblance between the two dialects is likely due to diffusion from New York City to New Orleans, occurring in the 19th century before bought-raising emerged in either variety.},

Acoustic measurements of F2?F1 were analysed using Bayesian linear mixed-effects modelling.Findings and conclusions:Our results show that bilingual children produce monolingual-like positional patterns in Sylheti, with very clear laterals in all positions. In contrast, bilinguals produce monolingual-like positional allophony in English, but they differ in phonetic detail, with bilinguals producing much clearer laterals than monolingual children across all positions.Originality:This study is the first to examine the development of allophonic contrast and phonetic detail in both of a bilingual?s languages in a contact scenario. This provides new insights into how contact varieties adopt aspects of structure and detail from each language. We also report valuable data from Sylheti-English bilinguals, who are an understudied community.Significance/limitations:Our study highlights the value of considering structural and detailed aspects of cross-linguistic sound systems, whereby one aspect may show monolingual-like patterns and another aspect may show distinctive patterns. We propose that the results in this study represent the development of a new sound system out of language contact, with second-generation bilingual children producing a hybrid system that combines influences from both heritage and host languages.},

	abstract = {It is well known that cross-linguistic interactions can exist between the two languages in a bilingual speaker’s repertoire. At the level of phonetics and phonology, this interaction may result in the transfer of a feature from one language to the other or the ‘merging’ of phonetic properties between languages. Although there are numerous studies of bilingual speakers which show such interactions, relatively little is known about the nature of transfer in communities of long-term bilingualism. The current study investigates phonological transfer of /r/ in Welsh-English bilinguals’ speech in north Wales. Specifically, it compares the influence of speaker gender, home language, and speech context on the production of /r/ in both English and Welsh in two communities which differ in the extent to which Welsh is spoken as a community language. It is commonly assumed that the alveolar trill [r] and alveolar tap [ɾ] are the variants of /r/ in Welsh. In English, the alveolar approximant [ɹ] is typical across Wales, but the trill and tap are reported in areas where a high proportion of the population speaks Welsh. Data in both languages were collected from 32 Welsh-English bilinguals (aged 16–18) via sociolinguistic interview and wordlist tasks. The sample was stratified equally by speaker gender, home language, and area (predominantly Welsh-speaking vs. predominantly English-speaking). The results show areal differences in the production of /r/ in both languages, which, I argue, could be attributed partly to differing social structures in the communities under investigation. Consequently, the results showed evidence of bi-directional phonological transfer, which is community-specific and influenced by a number of social factors.},

The spontaneous speech of 77 Basque–Spanish bilinguals was analyzed and compared to the perception results obtained from a matched-guise experiment. I situate this analysis using emergent participant self-identification categories that lie along a continuum of Basque speaker authenticity. Production results show that DOM use increases according to a speaker's self-ascribed authenticity, but the matched-guise analyses indicate that some DOM uses may undermine the speaker's perceived authenticity. I discuss the ideological multiplicity of DOM within its semiotic landscape and consider practice-based approaches to variation in explaining this paradox. The evidence lends support for social meaning-based accounts of variation that also consider speakerhood as an agentive process, and it additionally challenges models that directly correlate language use to acts of identity.},

Linguistic variation is explored via multivariate analysis of (linguistic and) social factors, in order to determine which factors best account for the selection of competing variants of selected sociolinguistic variables (primarily null subject variation and voice onset time) in spontaneous speech. The attitudinal or prestige aspect is explored in several ways: comparison of ethnolinguistic vitality, language status (in popular and academic media) and ethnic orientation. It is hypothesized that:??communities with a higher ethnolinguistic vitality will be more resistant to contact-induced variation;??varieties exhibiting more contact-induced variation will more likely have acquired a label distinct from the homeland variety;??within a generation, speakers with greater affinity for or more frequent use of English will show stronger contact effects; and??successive generations of speakers, with increasing contact with English, will show greater contact effects.Conclusions/originality/significance:These hypotheses are not supported by our data.},

	abstract = {From silva dimes to po-boys, r-lessness has long been a conspicuous feature of all dialects of New Orleans English. This dissertation presents a quantitative and qualitative description of current rates of r-lessness in the city. 71 speakers from 21 neighborhoods were interviewed. Rpronunciation was elicited in four contexts: interview chat, Katrina narratives, a reading passage and a word list. R-lessness was found in 39\% of possible instances. Older speakers pronounce /-r/ less than younger speakers, and those with a high school education or less pronounce /-r/ far less than those with post-secondary education. Race and gender did not prove to be significant predictors of r-pronunciation. In contrast to past studies, many speakers in the current study discuss their metalinguistic awareness of /-r/ and their partial control of /-r/ variation, discussing switching between r-fulness and r-lessness in different contexts.
In New Orleans, this metalinguistic awareness is attributable in part to the devastation following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the near-disappearance of the city intensified an already extant nostalgia for local culture, including ways of speaking. Nostalgia and amplification by advertisers and popular media have helped recontextualize r-lessness as a variable associated with a number of social meanings, including localness and authenticity. These processes help transform r-lessness, for many speakers, from a routine feature of talk to a floating cultural variable, serving as a semiotic resource on which speakers can draw on to perform localness.
This dissertation both closes a gap in research on New Orleans speech and uses New Orleans as a case study to suggest that the social meanings of linguistic features are created and maintained in part by a constellation of interrelated social processes of late modernity. Further, I argue that individual speakers are increasingly agentively engaged with these larger processes, as part of a global transformation from more traditional, place-bound populations to more deracinated individuals who choose to align themselves with particular communities and local cultural forms, particularly those that have been commodified.},

	abstract = {With the rise of interracial unions and changes in how society views these trends (as reflected by the 2000 Census' option for multiracial identification), multiracial identity development is an increasingly significant area of study in psychological literature. Responding to both the need for theory and research and professional recommendations related to the development of multicultural competencies, recent scholarship has elucidated concepts related to multiracial identity development and choice and the variables associated with these processes. In the literature review, a variety of theoretical models are described, including Kich's (1992) three-stage multiracial identity development model, Phinney's (1992) model on ethnic identity achievement, and Wijeyesinghe's Factor Model of Multiracial Identity (2001). Additionally, research findings regarding factors associated with racial identity choice in multiracial individuals were presented.
Although research has enhanced knowledge about racial and ethnic identity development by the exploration of Multiracial individuals, it has neglected communities that have a multi-generational history of interracial mixing (e.g., Melungeons, Creoles). Given the increasing pride in Creole heritage, the shift of traditional perspectives of race, and research trends in psychological study of multiracial identity development, attending to the experience of Louisiana Creoles of Color may prove to be a fruitful line of inquiry.
In light of these issues, the researcher examined how a sample of 94 Louisiana Creoles of Color racially categorized themselves and the factors associated with their choices. Specifically, the researcher investigated differences across racial identity choice (exclusively Black; alternately Black, Creole, and/or White; exclusively Creole; race-less) in the following variables: ethnic identity achievement; self-esteem; self-perceived skin color, social interpretation of appearance; negative treatment; perceived social status of Blacks; fluency in Creole dialect; and racial composition of pre-adult social context. Additionally, the researcher examined which combination of variables contributed to Creole racial identity as well as the relation between ethnic identity achievement and self-esteem. A section with open-ended questions was also included in order to enhance the results of the quantitative analyses.
A variety of factors were found to be associated with one's identification of Creole as a multiracial identity, particularly fluency in Creole dialect, self-perceived skin color, ethnic identity achievement, social interpretation of appearance, and racial composition of pre-adult social context. That is, greater proficiency in Creole dialect, lighter skin color, and greater ethnic identity achievement are associated with an exclusively Creole identity. Considering oneself exclusively Creole is also associated with having ambiguous physical features that are interpreted by others to convey a Creole appearance and being exposed to predominantly White childhood peers. Lower levels of self-esteem are associated with an alternating racial identity. Moreover, with a regression model that moderately fits the data, fluency in Creole dialect, self-perceived skin color, and self-esteem emerged as the best predictors of Creole racial identity.

	abstract = {In southwestern Louisiana, the public sphere is dominated by the image of the Cajuns, presented as a hardy, likable people who have overcome significant obstacles since their arrival as Acadians in the late eighteenth century. Across the cultural region designated “Acadiana,” which comprises 22 counties, nearly 30\% of the population is black (or Creole, mixed-race peoples generally identifying as black). Contributions of non-whites to the region’s history are usually not incorporated into the public historical narrative, and the erasure of these groups’ influences on the state’s cultural “gumbo” has profound symbolic and material consequences. Black/Creole residents note that much of their culture – primarily music and foodways – has been repackaged as Cajun or subsumed under the Cajun label and that they are unable to take advantage of the benefits that Creole-oriented tourism could bring to a region in which half of the counties are designated “black high poverty parishes.” Using mixed methods, including interviews, archival analysis, and census data, this paper explores the social, political, and economic consequences of the domination of Cajuns in the south Louisiana memorial and representational landscape and argues that commemorative silences in what Alderman et al. have called the “memorial arena” perpetuate a hegemonic social order.},

Content analysis of popular depictions over two centuries shows the features and structure of the image to be quite stable despite considerable economic and social change. The meaning of the depiction, though, has evolved as those who consider themselves Cajuns have taken up and re-worked the stereotypes of outsiders, re-valuing negative portrayals as positive traits. Building on Herbert Gans's symbolic ethnicity argument, we propose that this development highlights the oft-neglected role that outsiders' definitions play in ethnic identification, and that it suggests a possible answer to the question "What is symbolized in symbolic ethnicity?".},

	abstract = {Many Cajuns claim their Acadian ancestry, despite the fact that their culture is mixed, originating from the different immigrant groups which have settled in Louisiana (French, Acadian, Spanish, Irish, Black and White Creoles…). This sense of belonging appears through the enhancement of a “blood” filiation with the Acadians from the Canadian Maritimes Provinces, of a common historic memory based on the “Grand Dérangement” experience (the expulsion of the Acadians by the British in 1755) and of the survival theme. The bond felt with the Canadian Acadians is also based on the sharing of common language and values and goes to the perception of physical resemblance. The notion of Acadian Diaspora has grown these last years within the Louisiana French revival Movement, and has been fortified  by the World Acadian Congresses (in 1994 in New Brunswick and in 1999 in Lafayette). Even though this sense of belonging is not expressed by Cajuns as a whole, it represents a criterion of definition increasingly widespread, and has given rise to several recent initiatives in “Cajun Country” (located around Lafayette), such as the creation of the Acadian Memorial, the increase of genealogical societies, the setting of exhibitions about Acadian history, and the development of tourism between Louisiana-French and Canadian-French. However, this identity marker never comes into conflict with Cajuns’ American identity. Just like the Louisiana culture as a whole, the origins of Cajun culture are multiple. The metaphor most often employed to illustrate this process of creolization is of culinary nature. It uses a local specialty, gumbo, from which almost every ingredient reveals a different origin : the basic element, roux, comes from a French technique ; okra is a vegetable imported from Africa ; filé has an Native American origin ; finally, rice and the diverse ingredients incorporated (seafood, poultry, pork or wild game) are local products. Cajun last names also show such a process and reveal the diversity of this culture’s origins : German  (Hoffpauir, Shexnayder...), Spanish (Castille, Domingue, Romero...), Scottish (McGee), White Creole (de La Houssaye, Fontenot...), which come along Acadian origin (Leblanc, Broussard, Arceneaux...). However, this cultural mix is not always enhanced by Cajuns, since many increasingly emphasize their Acadian ancestry, which appears to be an essential criterion of definition of the group’s identity.},

We identify the festival as a key aspect of the Cajun revival since the 1960s. An examination of the history, activities, and contemporary spatiotemporal organization of festivals reveals similarities to other aspects of a society of mass consumption. Niche marketing , the structuring of recreation around the modern work week, and the establishment of personal identity through the purchase of symbolically rich commodities are all embodied in present - day Cajun festivals. At the same time, the consumption of ethnic commodities is linked by the consumers with a sense of tradition and descent from a mythic past. The festivals of southwestern Louisiana are, in this sense, invented traditions and, paradoxically, a measure of the assimilation of this particular ethnic group into American culture.},

	abstract = {Global environmental change is an ongoing and complex social problem that will continue to permeate all spheres of life on earth (Moran, 2010). Not all communities experience social and economic consequences of environmental change at the same level (Adger, 2006a; Cutter, Boruff, \& Shirley, 2003; Gillespie, 2010; Nicholls et al., 2007; Vogel, Moser, Kasperson, \& Dabelko, 2007). The variability of vulnerability, or potential for exposure or harm, stems from proximity to fragile ecosystems as well as social and economic differences across communities (Boruff, Emrich, \& Cutter, 2005). Additionally, environmental changes are projected to have adverse impacts on marginalized populations through additional pressures on existing, struggling social systems. Indigenous coastal communities, given their attachment to and dependence on the land, are especially vulnerable to environmental changes (Ford, 2012). In addition, indigenous peoples worldwide have poorer health compared to their majority groups (Anderson et al., 2006; Castor et al., 2006; Gracey \& King, 2009; King, Smith, \& Gracey, 2009; Lama, 2012).
To date, there is limited academic literature on the impact of climate change on health outcomes, especially among indigenous peoples (Ford et al., 2014). Land is a viable resource to indigenous communities both culturally and for future generations. Therefore, it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of the impacts of environmental changes on indigenous communities through engaging with them in research.
This community-engaged study uses a concurrent mixed methods design that involves collecting quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously, analyzing both sets of data, and then merging those results with the purpose of comparing the results with each other (Creswell, 2015) using non-probability sampling strategies. A community advisory council was developed to guide culturally relevant research procedures.
Quantitative data was collected through an interviewer-administered survey (N=160) from United Houma Nation (UHN) members in Terrebonne Parish to test theoretical model to assess whether environmental changes relate to indigenous health outcomes after controlling for the moderating effects of indigenous-specific factors: connection to land, historical trauma, discrimination, social support, and ethnic identity. Qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews (N=19) with a subset of survey participants on their shared cultural experiences of environmental changes to expand our understanding from the quantitative results. The aim of this study is to understand the health (physical, emotional, and mental) outcomes of environmental changes and shared cultural experiences among indigenous peoples in south Louisiana.
Three notable findings from this study will advance empirical knowledge of environmental change exposure among indigenous peoples: (1) The study builds on previous qualitative knowledge that indigenous peoples exposed to environmental changes experience negative health consequences by quantifying their experience and showing direct relationships to health outcomes and indigenous-specific experiences. (2) There is an interconnected cyclical nature of the shared cultural experiences of exposure to environmental changes. These themes further refine the theoretical framework presented in this study. (3) Discrimination predicted poor mental health, reiterating the need to investigate contemporary trauma and makes a call to reclaim traditional knowledge and practices through developing community healing interventions.
The World Bank predicts that by 2050, environmental changes will be the global challenge (World-Bank, 2010). To social workers, this will mean that environmental changes will permeate every aspect of the client’s social environment. The American Academy of Social Workers highlighted how the social work profession is well positioned to call attention to the negative effects of global environmental change with the Environmental Change Grand Challenge (Kemp \& Palinkas, 2015). In fact, social workers are already involved in addressing environmental changes like natural and man-made disasters. For these reasons, I believe social work professionals will continue to carve out their role in addressing challenges of environmental change in what will be the global challenge of the century (Dominelli, 2012).},

Based on this literature and focus group interviews, the bicultural identity of 300 young adults from immigrant families was examined, and a new bicultural identity instrument was developed, which included subscales assessing conflicted, monocultural, situationally alternating, complementary and hybrid identity orientations. The reliability indices and factor structure supported the distinctiveness of each of these subscales, and correlational analyses supported their validity. A second survey confirmed the factor structure and demonstrated meaningful differences between first- and second-generation Canadians (G1: n = 367 and G2: n = 217, respectively). In particular, both groups endorsed identity hybridity and complementarity more strongly than alternation and alternation was endorsed more strongly than monoculturality and identity conflict. As well, the G1 group reported more conflicted, monocultural and alternating identities than did the G2 group, and the G2 group reported more complementary and hybrid identities than the G1 group. These findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the diversity of identity experiences of bicultural persons, as well as an instrument to assess these orientations.},

British Asian speakers, on the other hand, are often described as producing much ‘clearer’ realisations of /l/, but the specific differences between varieties may vary by geographical location. Regression analysis of liquid steady states and Smoothing Spline ANOVAs of vocalic–liquid formant trajectories show consistent F2−F1 differences in /l/ between Anglo and Asian speakers in non-final contexts, which is suggestive of a strong distinction between varieties in terms of clearness/darkness. There is also evidence of a polarity effect in liquids, with differing relationships between liquid phonemes in each variety: Asian speakers produce /l/ with higher F2−F1 values than /ɹ/, and Anglo speakers produce /ɹ/ with higher F2−F1 values than /l/.

	abstract = {Taking Cajuns as a case study, Good God but You Smart! explores the subtle ways language bias is used in classrooms, within families, and in pop culture references to enforce systemic economic inequality. It is the first book in composition studies to examine comprehensively, and from an insider’s perspective, the cultural and linguistic assimilation of Cajuns in Louisiana.  The study investigates the complicated motivations and cultural concessions of upwardly mobile Cajuns who “choose” to self-censor—to speak Standardized English over the Cajun English that carries their cultural identity. Drawing on surveys of English teachers in four Louisiana colleges, previously unpublished archival data, and Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of the legitimate language, author Nichole Stanford explores how socioeconomic and political pressures rooted in language prejudice make code switching, or self-censoring in public, seem a responsible decision. Yet teaching students to skirt others’ prejudice toward certain dialects only puts off actually dealing with the prejudice. Focusing on what goes on outside classrooms, Stanford critiques code switching and cautions users of code meshing that pedagogical responses within the educational system are limited by the reproductive function of schools. Each theory section includes parallel memoir sections in the Cajun tradition of storytelling to open an experiential window to the study without technical language.  Through its explication of language legitimacy and its grounding in lived experience, Good God but You Smart! is an essential addition to the pedagogical canon of language minority studies like those of Villanueva, Gilyard, Smitherman, and Rose.},

	abstract = {The intersections of issues of race, identity and language are at a pivotal moment in the modern U.S., with the rapidly increasing percentage of the population identifying as more than one race, and accompanying social challenges to traditional black/white binary. In this zeitgeist, young people with parents of differing racial and ethnic backgrounds exist in a space where they may form and perform racial identity through a process of psychological, sociological, and linguistic choices. The U.S.’s first black and biracial president, Barack Obama is a masterful code-switcher between Mainstream U.S. English (MUSE) and African American Language (AAL), serving as a powerful representation of the fluidity of multiple identities and their effects on ideologies about language and race. This dissertation investigates the relationship between racial identity and linguistic performance by examining aspects of the linguistic repertoires of a group of college-educated Millennial generation men (aged 18-32) with one black parent and one white parent, particularly exploring the ways in which these individuals perform and reflect their racial identities in conversations with white and black friends.
The current study focuses on how these speakers may employ identity-conditioned variation in their linguistic performances, particularly with respect to their use of ethnically-linked intonational features. These features are particularly of interest because despite their high level of salience for listeners in ethnic identification, their role in ethnolinguistic variation is not yet well understood. This study examines speaker data in conversations with white and black friend interlocutors, and is especially interested in comparing intra and interspeaker variation. Results of regression models for a number of intonational features, including peak delay, quantity and type of pitch accents, and focus marking strategies reveal that some speakers do employ different intonational features with white versus black interlocutors. More powerfully, however, the speakers studied here demonstrate more interspeaker variation than intraspeaker variation, and this is especially evident in their use of the L+H* versus H* pitch accents and their strategies for marking focus. When combined with the results of qualitative analysis of sociolinguistic interview and questionnaire data, it is evident that a speaker’s conceptualization of his own racial identity affects his use of these linguistic features. Speakers who align themselves more with blackness employ the L+H* pitch accent more often, and are also more likely to use this pitch accent specifically in narrow focus marking. These findings reveal a potential indexical relationship between AAL intonational features and speaker identity conceptualization, which motivates further investigation of the role of intonation in ethnolinguistic identity for a variety of speakers. This finding is also of interest to the linguistic study of intonation due to the fact that the use of a particular pitch accent to mark narrow focus has not been previously attested in English.
These results represent an exciting direction for future sociolinguistic work that examines ethnolinguistic identity through the lens of performance. It also motivates future work on the role of intonational variation in both MUSE and AAL. As sociolinguistic research has demonstrated that listeners rely on intonation to make racialized judgments about speakers, understanding this type of variation is also especially important for addressing linguistic profiling and discrimination.},

	abstract = {The growing reliance on off-farm employment in industrialized societies has become a topic of considerable research interest. Although attention has been paid to the impact of multiple job holding on the economic well-being and the internal organization of farm families, there is a lack of discussion on how this may affect external social relations among these families. Examining farm couples in Louisiana, this paper treats their work-role statuses as an interface between the worlds of agricultural production and the larger economy and as an intrusion into traditional patterns of external social relationships (i.e., social networks) of the farm family. While off-farm employment, especially in white collar occupations, reduces the proportion of farmers found in social networks, over all, it has litde impact on the structure or composition of these networks. Of greater significance, the farm background of the husband is strongly associated with traditional forms of external social relationships. Patterns of social interaction established earlier in life appear to reproduce themselves across generations of farm families. Implications of these findings for the structure of agriculture are discussed. Résumé Le développement de ľ emploi extra-agricole dans les sociétés industrialisées est devenu un thème ? un intérét scientifique croissant. Si on a bien prêté attention à son impact sur le bien-être économique et sur ľorganisation interne des families agricoles, on a relativement peu étudié ses effets sur les relations sociales externes de ces families.

Kurzfassung Die Zunahme der außerlandwirtschafdichen Erwerbstätigkeit in industrialisierten Gesellschaften ist Gegenstand beträchtlichen wissenschaftlichen Interesses geworden. Beachrung hat vor allem die Bedeutung der Mehrfachbeschäftigung für die ökonomische Situation und innere Organisation landwirtschafdicher Familien gefunden, doch fehlt eine Diskussion über deren Wirkungen auf die externen sozialen Beziehungen dieser Familien. Durch Untersuchungen bei landwirtschaftlichen Ehepaaren in Louisiana werden in dem Beitrag die Arbeitsrollen-Status als eine Verbindung zwischen landwirtschaflicher Produktion und der übrigen Wirtschaft und als eine Erweiterung traditioneller Muster externer sozialer Beziehungen (z.B. soziale Netzwerke) der landwirtschaflichen Familien behandelt. Während mit auβerbetrieblicher Erwerbstätigkeit, insbesondere höher qualifizierten Tatigkeiten, der Anteil von sozialen Netzwerken angehörenden Landwirten generell abnimmt, hat dies doch wenig Bedeutung für die Struktur oder Zusammenseczung dieser Netzwerke. Von größerer Bedeutung ist, daß der landwirtschaftliche Hintergrund des Ehemannes eng mit traditionellen Formen externer sozialer Beziehungen verbunden ist. Soziale Interaktionsmuster, die früher im Leben entwickelt wurden, scheinen sich selbst über Generationen zu reproduzieren. Die Bedeutung dieser Ergebnisse für die Struktur der Landwirtschaft wird diskutiert.},

The understanding that one must ask to receive--that no thank-you is required--is the potentiality in the silence following traitement. Traiteurs use treatments to connect with the area's past history of small farming communities, or voisinages, through a sophisticated display of reciprocity, and to articulate their relationship to a local notion of community.

Our results are generally consistent with these predictions. We then present evidence for rural diversity by comparing data from residents of a two-parish nonmetropolitan area in southwestern Louisiana to the nonmetropolitan subsample of the GSS. After discussing possible mechanisms for this covariation of spatial and aspatial communities, we conclude by commenting on the potential of network analysis to contribute to the resolution of these and other substantively important problems in rural sociology.},

It is essentially a sociolinguistic study which aims to identify the range of language which we found in this community and its social and situational determinants. There are many questions which relate to research design, methodology and analysis which are of primary interest to linguists. However, the fact that the study is based on a British Black community means that its findings are of interest to a much broader audience which includes teachers, sociologists, speech therapists, youth and community workers and, of course, black people themselves.},

Rather, they are patterns of relations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author develops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation.},

	abstract = {Depuis le début du 19e siècle, le français s'est vu progressivement remplacé par l'anglais, langue officielle qui s'utilise dans les domaines prestigieux de la vie sociale en Louisiane. Depuis le début du 20e siècle, on constate une régression notable de la vitalité des variétés vernaculaires du français en Acadiana, la région où habite la majorité des habitants d'origine francophone. Les années cinquante ont néanmoins attesté un renouveau d'intérêt dans l'héritage culturel et linguistique francophone.
Ce renouveau culturel a abouti à un renouveau linguistique. En 1968, le Conseil pour le Développement du Français en Louisiane (le CODOFIL) a été créé. Le CODOFIL a pour mission de réintroduire le français dans le système scolaire et espère ainsi restaurer le bilinguisme français/anglais en Louisiane. Au début du CODOFIL, l'enseignement du français se limitait à des cours de langue seconde. Les élèves n'acquérraient pas cependant de compétence fonctionnelle communicative en français. Depuis les années 80, des programmes d'immersion ont été créés pour assurer la création de jeunes Louisianais fonctionnellement bilingues.
Depuis sa fondation, le CODOFIL fait la promotion d'une norme officielle, le français standard, qui diffère de la norme communautaire, le français cadien et créole. En effet, jusqu'à récemment, la question de l'enseignement du vernaculaire avait été largement occultée du discours sur l'aménagement du français. Depuis les années quatre vingt, cependant, certains administrateurs font un effort de louisianifier l'éducation linguistique. Les enseignants sont actuellement encouragés à intégrer le vocabulaire franco-louisianais dans leur enseignement.
Cette étude a cherché à connaître les attitudes linguistiques des participants à l'immersion afin de savoir à quel point la louisianification du progranune est possible. Les résultats ont montré que la louisianification limitée de l'éducation linguistique est possible en Acadiana. Les participants à l'immersion, quoique réticents à exprimer leurs attitudes, estiment quil est possible d'enseigner le vernaculaire. Ils sont surtout en faveur de la promotion du vocabulaire franco-louisianais lorsqu'il s'agit de la culture. Pour réussir la louisianification de l'immersion, un projet de conscientisation, comme celui déjà en place pour les enseignants, doit se faire auprés des parents et des administrateurs afin d'améliorer leurs attitudes par rapport au vernaculaire et à sa promotion scolaire.},

While most cases of linguistic diffusion, particularly of African American English, are found in speakers with a positive affiliation with the source dialect (e.g., Bucholtz, 1999; Cutler, 1999; Fix, 2010), here the white adopters of (TH)-fronting exhibit overtly hostile attitudes toward black neighbors. I argue that (TH)-fronting has been adopted as an index of street or masculinity by the white speakers in this study. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the phonological constraints on borrowed (TH)-fronting have been restricted and simplified from the constraints in the source dialect. Finally, I discuss how hostile interactions may play a role in language change, allowing change in dialects not only to proceed in tandem across unexpected boundaries (e.g., Milroy \& Milroy, 1985), but also to be directly diffused across hostile boundaries.},

This principle—the homophily principle—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

We use data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys to ask whether the strengths of five social distinctions—sex, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, age, and education—changed over the past two decades in core discussion networks. Changes in the actual level of homophily are driven by the demographic composition of the United States. As the nation has become more diverse, cross-category contacts in race/ethnicity and religion have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a case-control model to assess homophily relative to chance mixing. We find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and age, although the young are increasingly isolated from older cohorts outside of the family. We also find some weak evidence for increasing educational and religious homophily. These relational trends may be explained by changes in demographic heterogeneity, institutional segregation, economic inequality, and symbolic boundaries.},

One of the striking features of this new mixture of peoples, however, is that this new diversity often occurs in tandem with racial concentration. This article surveys these new geographies from four points of view: the nation as a whole, states, large metropolitan areas, and neighborhoods. The analysis at each scale relies on a new taxonomy of racial composition that simultaneously appraises both diversity and the lack thereof (Holloway, Wright, and Ellis 2012). Urban analysis often posits neighborhood racial segregation and diversity as either endpoints on a continuum of racial dominance or mirror images of one another. We disturb that perspective and stress that segregation and diversity must be jointly understood—they are necessarily related, although not as inevitable binary opposites. Using census data from 1990, 2000, and 2010, the research points to how patterns of racial diversity and dominance interact across varying spatial scales. This investigation helps answer some basic questions about the changing geographies of racialized groups, setting the stage for the following articles that explore the relationship between geography and the participation of underrepresented groups in higher education.},

Examining different aspects of our data, we fit two mixed-effects models, one that analyzes the four most frequent phonological variants of the atonic pronoun je ‘I’ and the other that focuses on the tonic pronoun mon ‘me.’ Several linguistic and social factors predict the use of these subject forms, supporting the claim that variability in declining languages is systematic, just as variation in healthy languages is.

	abstract = {The native French population of Newfoundland is with few exceptions restricted to four communities--L'Anse-a-Canards, Cap St.-Georges, La Grand'Terre, and Stephenville--in the Port-au-Port Peninsula/Bay St. George area of the west coast. The French spoken here is a little-studied variety of Acadian. In this thesis covariation of a number of phonological and grammatical variables with both linguistic environment and a number of social factors is quantified. While the main orientation of the study is sociolinguistic, Labovian techniques developed for a single speech community have been implemented in the four Francophone communities of the area. Thus the study combines elements of the dialect geographer's approach with the methodology current in sociolinguistics.
The dependent variables all relate to clitic pronoun usage. They include phonological variation of third person subject clitics and of object clitics lui, leur, and en. Grammatical variables include third person case and number marking, variation in cliticization of first, second, and third person object pronouns, of reflexive pronouns and of y and en.
Both phonological and grammatical variation were found to be conditioned by linguistic and social factors. For example, phonological environment affects deletion of the /l/ of third person subject clitics. Loss of third person case marking is more prevalent in the faire-infinitive grammatical construction. Unlike in many other sociolinguistic studies, the social variable sex did not condition variation to any great degree. The intracommunity variable locality was found to be somewhat more important. Younger speakers in one community, La Grand'Terre, stood out as less conservative than their counterparts in other communities. Age emerged as the most important nonlinguistic variable in this study. Younger speakers, for example, tend to cliticize object pronouns less often than do older speakers, which may well mark a linguistic change in progress.},

We argue that when studying social support, multiple name generators ensure that researchers sample from a multidimensional definition of support. However, because administering multiple name generators is time consuming and strains respondent motivation, researchers often use single name generators. We compared network measures obtained from single generators to measures obtained from a six-item multiple-name generator. Although some single generators provided passable estimates of some measures, no single generator provided reliable estimates across a broad spectrum of network measures. We then evaluated two alternative methods of reducing respondent burden: (1) the MMG, a multiple generator using the two most robust name generators and (2) the MGRI, a six-item name generator with name interpreters administered for a random subset of alters. Both the MMG and the MGRI were more reliable than single generators when measuring size, density, and mean measures of network composition or activity, though some single name generators were more reliable for measures consisting of sums or counts.},

	abstract = {There is considerable disagreement about the best personal network name generator to employ when only a single question is practical. One general approach is to ask the respondents (egos) to delineate the core members (alters) of their personal networks according to affective criteria (e.g., “the most significant people in your life”). Another approach provides more guidance to the egos by asking about alters with whom they have had specific interactions or social exchanges (e.g., “discuss important matters”). Finally, most name generators have been criticized for their preoccupation with positive ties to the exclusion of the difficult or negative relationships that may be an important part of ego's social world. An experiment (2×2 factorial design) was embedded within an interviewer-administered survey of 426 college students to explore the effects on reported network size and composition of (a) varying the delineation criteria (“significant people” or the 1985 General Social Survey (GSS) “important matters”) and (b) including or excluding a probe for negative interactions (“These may include people that sometimes make you angry or upset”). The name-generator wording manipulations produced modest network compositional differences (ego–alter role relationships and discussion topics) that varied by the sex of both egos and their alters. Compared to the “important matters” criterion, the “significant people” generator elicited slightly more cross-sex relatives and fewer same-sex close friends and co-workers from female (but not male) respondents. The negative probe produced some statistically significant but substantively unimportant compositional differences. The results suggest that major differences in name-generator wording may in some situations have little or no effect on reported egocentric networks.},

The analyses find that leaders of this change are younger speakers, women, those with more educational attainment, those of service and professional occupations, and those from Huelva. The implications are that large-scale societal changes have allowed for the split of the ceceo merger into distinción in both speech communities, albeit at different rates of change due to their unique socioeconomic histories, demonstrating that a split is possible given the right social context.},

Variationist methodology is adopted in a context of gradual language death.

It is argued that style variation (not monostylism) emerges from linguistic decay: among more fluent speakers, a categorical rule of /l/-palatalization before obstruents becomes underspecified, rendering palatalization available for strategic use. Among new speakers, novel palatal variants form part of an emergent sociolinguistic norm. The study offers fresh insights on the origins of sociolinguistic variation with implications for variationist theory.

	abstract = {The role of trade unions for public policy, public policy outcomes, and political behaviour is a wellstudied topic. A serious shortcoming in this literature is that unions are usually treated as unitary actors. This is striking since not least the Scandinavian countries saw the membership growth in independent white-collar unions and their federations at the expense of the traditional blue-collar (and thus textbook-style) union federations. The growth of independent white-collar unions implies that the traditional assumptions about unions as advocates of redistribution and state intervention do not necessarily hold because this type of union represents potential ‘losers’ of redistribution and intervention. Moreover, their members do support less redistribution and more market-based allocation of incomes as well as privatization, since the solidarity effect fostered by traditional unionism is weakened if the higher-income strata are organized in separate federations. Consequently, this study addresses an important gap in the literature on union membership and political preferences by analysing the attitudes towards redistribution and state–market relations in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden across union federation membership in the past three decades. The ﬁndings demonstrate that members of independent academic/professional unions support market allocation of incomes and less state intervention, while the opposite is true for members of traditional blue-collar union federations. The effect of income on attitudes towards state and market is also consistently stronger in the independent white-collar federations in the three countries, which supports the muted solidarity effect in this type of union.},

	abstract = {The sociology of professions has so far had limited connections to emergency services occupations. Research on emergency occupations tends to focus on workplace culture and identity, often emphasizing continuity rather than change. Police ofﬁcers, ﬁreﬁghters, and paramedics have their historical roots in manual, technical, or ‘semi-professional’ occupations and their working lives still bear many of the hallmarks of blue-collar, uniformed ‘street-level’ work. But uniformed emergency services—like many other occupations—are increasingly undergoing processes of ‘professionalization’. The organizations in which they are employed and the ﬁelds in which they work have undergone signiﬁcant change and disruption, calling into question the core features, cultures, and duties of these occupations. This article argues that sociology of work on emergency services could be helpfully brought into closer contact with the sociology of professions in order to better understand these changes. It suggests four broad empirical and conceptual domains where meaningful connections can be made between these literatures, namely, leadership and authority; organizational goals and objectives; professional identities; and ‘extreme’ work. Emergency services are evolving in complex directions while retaining certain long-standing and entrenched features. Studying emergency occupations as professions also sheds new light on the changing nature of ‘professionalism’ itself.},

As in the past, declines were centered in the South and West and in areas with smaller black populations. Increases in Hispanic and Asian segregation in individual metropolitan areas were counterbalanced by a net movement of these two groups toward areas of lower segregation. These increases were associated especially with the more rapid growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations. Hispanic segregation increased more in regions where group members had declining incomes relative to the incomes of whites and included a growing share of immigrants.},

Through meta-linguistic commentary and acoustic analyses drawn from sociolinguistic interviews with white Jewish and Catholic Chicagoans, we find that meta-linguistic ideologies associate Jewish speakers with New York City English and white Catholic speakers with ‘local’ Chicago features. However, in actual production, these linguistic differences appear to be driven by neighborhood rather than ethnoreligious identity alone. We argue that while meta-linguistic commentary may re-circulate broader linguistic ideologies, the uptake of elements of the ethnolinguistic repertoire may depend on the social meanings of those features in the local community more broadly, including class- and place-linked variation.

First, the cost of switching languages, relative to staying in the same language, is similar across the two languages. The second effect is more uniquely connected to voluntary language switching, namely a benefit when performing in mixed language blocks relative to single language blocks, which has been connected to proactive language control. If a similar pattern could be observed with bidialectals in a voluntary language switching paradigm, then this would provide additional evidence in favor of similar control processes underlying bidialectal and bilingual language production.},

of two experiments utilizing a novel experimental paradigm for eliciting convergence—the wordnaming
game task—in which participants read aloud (baseline) or hear (exposure) clues describing
particular words and then give their guesses out loud. Participants converged toward a
Southern-shifted model talker by producing more glide-weakened tokens of /aɪ/, without ever
hearing the model talker produce this vowel. Participants in the control (Midland talker) condition
exhibited no such response. Convergence was facilitated by both living in the South and producing
less-weakened baseline /aɪ/ glides, but attitudinal and domain-general individual-differences
measures did not reliably predict convergence behaviors. Results are discussed in terms of implications
for the cognitive mechanisms underlying convergence behaviors and the mental representations
of sociolinguistic knowledge.},

To date, this phenomenon has been investigated in non-interactive laboratory tasks extensively and in conversational interaction to a lesser degree. The present study directly compares phonetic convergence in conversational interaction and in a non-interactive speech shadowing task among a large set of talkers who completed both tasks, using a holistic AXB perceptual similarity measure. Phonetic convergence occurred in a new role-neutral conversational task, exhibiting a subtle effect with high variability across talkers that is typical of findings reported in previous research. Conversational phonetic convergence did not differ by talker sex on average, but relationships between speech shadowing and conversational convergence differed according to talker sex, with female talkers showing no consistency across settings in their relative levels of convergence and male talkers showing a modest relationship. These findings indicate that phonetic convergence is not directly compatible across different settings, and that phonetic convergence of female talkers in particular is sensitive to differences across different settings. Overall, patterns of acoustic–phonetic variation and convergence observed both within and between different settings of language use are inconsistent with accounts of automatic perception-production integration.},

The current experiment investigates this phenomenon, examining whether vowel spectra are automatically imitated in a lexical shadowing task and how social liking affects imitation. Participants were assigned to either a Black talker or White talker; within this talker manipulation, participants were either put into a condition with a digital image of their assigned model talker or one without an image. Liking was measured through attractiveness rating. Participants accommodated toward vowels selectively; the low vowels /æ ɑ/ showed the strongest effects of imitation compared to the vowels /i o u/, but the degree of this trend varied across conditions. In addition to these findings of phonetic selectivity, the degree to which these vowels were imitated was subtly affected by attractiveness ratings and this also interacted with the experimental condition.

Knowledge of how humans organize and relate their ideas and behavior within a society can help us to understand our actions and attitudes toward different issues. However, the selection of common traits that shape a cultural area is somewhat arbitrary. What is needed is a method that can leverage the massive amounts of data coming online, especially through social media, to identify cultural regions without ad-hoc assumptions, biases, or prejudices. This work takes a crucial step in this direction by introducing a method to infer cultural regions based on the automatic analysis of large datasets from microblogging posts. The approach presented here is based on the principle that cultural affiliation can be inferred from the topics that people discuss among themselves. Specifically, regional variations in written discourse are measured in American social media. From the frequency distributions of content words in geotagged tweets, the regional hotspots of words’ usage are found, and from there, principal components of regional variation are derived. Through a hierarchical clustering of the data in this lower-dimensional space, this method yields clear cultural areas and the topics of discussion that define them. It uncovers a manifest North–South separation, which is primarily influenced by the African American culture, and further contiguous (East–West) and non-contiguous divisions that provide a comprehensive picture of modern American cultural areas.},

	abstract = {The article addresses the contribution of multilingualism to cultural diversity and the importance of explicit, comprehensive and public language planning to secure a stronger future for endangered indigenous and immigrant languages. It is critically important to develop language policies that ensure the access of minority populations to prestigious forms of national standard languages and literacies while supporting the intergenerational retention of minority languages, both indigenous and immigrant languages. These twin objectives are complementary but require a more expert practice of language planning. The multilingualism which is advocated aims to be nationally cohesive, economically productive and socially just. An enhanced practice of intervention on behalf of multilingualism is discussed in sections devoted to the mechanisms and activity of language policy-making. Contemporary globalisation is a challenge for language diversity but in some ways makes the intergenerational retention of diverse languages more feasible than under conditions of strict assimilation as practiced by linguistically defined nation-states. Also potentially supportive of multilingualism are the voice-based communication technologies that overcome the tyranny of distance and dispersal, and promise access to information, communication and solidarity for preliterate groups or those that have limited literacy. The roles of language in memory and cultural production underscore how central language in its various genres is to culture. As a result, efforts to appreciate and foster human differences require awareness of the importance of multilingualism. The endangered state of many of the world's languages and the now almost universal phenomenon of multiculturalism make the practice of language planning a central instrument for states, international agencies and non-governmental bodies.},

This paper aims to explore the language networks that are formed as the basis of user interactions in Twitter (an online social network platform). Using Network Science approaches, we unveil the "Twitter language network" as a whole is a connected system of many different languages that acts as an enabler of information spread. The connected language structure arises due to the presence of many multilingual speakers. Our work also sheds light on the similarity of languages from a speaker-preference point of view.},

In the quest for language diversity and universal access, the vision of a cosmopolitan Internet has stumbled over the language frontier.

Expatriates, minorities, diaspora communities, and language learners play an important role in forming transnational networks, creating social ties across borders. This research investigates how multilingual users of Twitter mediate between language groups in their social network, focusing on social connections and language choice. This research contributes an original classification of network types based on the patterns of connections between language groups within the social networks of multilingual users. Also, it applies the novel idea of modeling the influence of network factors in the language choices of the user.

This essay, which builds on an emerging literature around decentralized social media, seeks to give an overview of the Fediverse, its benefits and drawbacks, and how government action can influence and encourage its development.Part I describes the Fediverse and how it works, beginning with a general description of open versus closed protocols and then proceeding to a description of the current Fediverse ecosystem, focusing on its major protocols and applications. Part II looks at the specific issue of content moderation on the Fediverse, using Mastodon, a Twitter-like microblogging service, as a case study to draw out the advantages and disadvantages of the federated content-moderation approach as compared to the current dominant closed-platform model. Part III considers how policymakers can encourage the Fediverse, whether through direct regulation, antitrust enforcement, or liability shields.},

	abstract = {As an alternative to Twitter and other centralized social networks, the Fediverse is growing in popularity. The recent, and polemical, takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk has exacerbated this trend. The Fediverse includes a growing number of decentralized social networks, such as Pleroma or Mastodon, that share the same subscription protocol (ActivityPub). Each of these decentralized social networks is composed of independent instances that are run by different administrators. Users, however, can interact with other users across the Fediverse regardless of the instance they are signed up to. The growing user base of the Fediverse creates key challenges for the administrators, who may experience a growing burden. In this paper, we explore how large that overhead is, and whether there are solutions to alleviate the burden. We study the overhead of moderation on the administrators. We observe a diversity of administrator strategies, with evidence that administrators on larger instances struggle to find sufficient resources. We then propose a tool, WatchGen, to semi-automate the process.},

	abstract = {Decentralized online social networks (DOSNs) have recently emerged as a viable solution to preserve the users' privacy and ensure higher users' control over the contents they publish. However, little is known about the backlashes that the decentralized organization and management of these platforms may have on the overlaid social network. This paper fills the gap. Specifically, we investigate how a decentralized architecture based on distributed servers impacts the structure of the users' neighborhood and their ego-networks. Our analysis relies on social data gathered from the decentralized micro-blogging platform Mastodon, the newest and fastest-growing decentralized alternative to Twitter. Our findings highlight that the social network supported by each server, namely instance, has a specific footprint in terms of degree distribution and clustered structure of the ego-networks of its members. Further, how users connect to people hosted in other instances is heavily bound by the server they are in. Moreover, users who tend to establish relationships in outer instances prefer to use a bunch of servers. Finally, we show that the ego-networks of the users are more clustered within the instance boundary, i.e. triangles are more likely to form among members of the same instance. All these findings suggest that the decentralization drives the social network to a structure that can be potentially very different from the usual one typical of centralized online social networks. Thus, the architecture of a DOSN is a factor developers and researchers should take into account when designing this kind of social platforms.},

We manually annotate both dialogues and sentiments on this corpus, and train a multi-task hierarchical recurrent network on joint sentiment and dialog act recognition. We experimentally demonstrate that transfer learning may be efficiently achieved between both tasks, and further analyze some specific correlations between sentiments and dialogues on social media.

The linguistic manifestations of metaphor in the corpus were identified using the MIPVU procedure (Steen et al., 2010), a revised and extended version of the original Metaphor Identification Procedure, or MIP, as developed by the Pragglejaz Group (2007). Contrary to common expectations, fiction was not the register with the highest number of metaphors, but was situated in between academic discourse and news on the one hand, and conversation on the other. However, it turned out that metaphor signals and direct expressions of metaphor (e.g. simile) were typical of fiction, as has been claimed in the literature (e.g. Goatly, 1997; Lodge, 1977; Sayce, 1953). Based on these quantitative findings, this article will show that fiction does not contain more metaphors than the other registers, but rather, different ones.},

The results show that there is a cline from the a priori more formal registers to the less formal registers for the stance markers investigated. When the apprentice writers’ usage was mapped onto this cline, it became clear that their usage diverged slightly from that of the academic experts, thus indicating a lack of register awareness.

Learner writing is compared to expert writing from several different registers and to native-speaker student writing. The results show that there are important differences across both registers and text types. Furthermore, while the learners’ use is most like that of the experts’ academic writing, certain similarities to the non-academic registers were also noted.

More specifically, we report on methodological decisions and their implications for representational politics in two towns, Zbąszyń in Poland and Annaberg-Buchholz in Germany, during consecutive waves of regime changes since the First World War. We rely on a complex data-set consisting of maps, town hall documents, street directories, newspapers and interviews with administrative officials. Visualisation of geographical patterns allows us to illustrate the outcomes of different definitions of ideology and explore how these definitions affect our analysis.

Those proficient in English or Arabic have more access to information than those who are not. While effective communication is important in ordinary times, it is especially vital during a crisis. This study looks at COVID-19 signage in two Abu Dhabi live-work contexts: A beachside community and an industrial site. The study takes an ethnographic approach to linguistic landscaping in which a corpus of 326 top-down and bottom-up signs are investigated in terms of languages used, spacing, prominence and location, as well as intended audience and sociolinguistic implications. Key findings revealed that bottom-up handmade COVID-19 signage was mainly monolingual (English only) and municipality-produced warnings were predominately bilingual (Arabic and English). Despite the multilingual composition of both contexts, only one third language (Korean) appeared on COVID-19 signage. The findings shed light on existing inequalities in linguistically diverse contexts, and the need to ensure access to information for all at a street level.

	abstract = {I explore the ways in which language ideologies are transformed when they are transplanted to diasporic settings as a result of migration. I examine the labelling of Cypriot Greek features as slang by young British-born speakers of Greek Cypriot heritage. Drawing on the analysis of data collected in a Greek complementary school in London, I suggest that slang is applied to Cypriot Greek through a process of re-enregisterment that redefines the contrast it forms with Standard Greek in the model of the slang vs posh English binary, which is local to the London context and is constructed along the lines of the ideological schemata of properness and correctness that also define the opposition between Cypriot Greek and Standard Greek in Cyprus. I propose that the policy and practice of teaching Greek in the school is a key enabler in this process as it constructs Standard Greek as a language that can and must be written and Cypriot Greek as a language that can only be spoken but never written. This allows complementary school pupils to draw links with institutional discourses they are exposed to in mainstream education about the inappropriateness of including elements labelled as slang in their writing.},

Interviews with speakers from different parts of Yorkshire revealed that the most frequently defined variety of “Yorkshire” dialect was “Barnsley”. When demonstrating how this variety differed from other Yorkshire varieties, informants produce a fronted vowel in the first syllable of ‘Barnsley’. I illustrate that this pronunciation has indexical links (Johnstone, Andrus, and Danielson 2006) to social values such as 'broad' and 'traditional', and that it is enregistered (Agha 2003) as a Barnsley feature. I conclude that language features can index multiple geographical areas simultaneously and that Yorkshire dialect is not only enregistered as a single variety, but also as sub-Yorkshire varieties.},

Public education and other systems of structural power instill the ideological contrast between nonrepresentational and representational: ideophones are placed in opposition to abstract, arbitrary symbols, just like “primitive” Naso identity is hegemonically placed in opposition to “civilized” Spanish identity. Colonial ideologization places the “rube” character in the past, incongruent with modern representation, and indexes this character through ideophonic signs. However, Naso individuals play on the ideophone stereotype through subversive inverted mockery; they create alternative interpretations of subjects in order to form social solidarity and alignment with other Nasos.},

The present study contributes to the last of these three methodologies by exploring which pronouns native English speakers use when writing about a genderless person (i.e., “the ideal student”). The results of this study indicate that a large majority of participants (79\%) include a gender-inclusive approach (he or she type constructions or singular they) when referring to a singular, genderless antecedent; 68\% use singular they. However, participants note that he or she type variations do not include some who may not identify within the gender binary.},

	shorttitle = {The evolution of the {French} indefinite pronoun on},
	abstract = {The goal of the present work is twofold. First, it aims to provide a detailed, corpus-based study in the diachronic grammaticalization of a pronominal form from a lexical form. Based on numerous examples from texts ranging from the pre-classical Latin through the Old French periods, the semantic, syntactic, phonological, and orthographic development of the French indefinite pronoun on ‘one, people’ is traced from its lexical origins in Latin as the noun homo ‘a human being, man, person’. These developments are interpreted, in large part, relative to current grammaticalization theory. The second goal of this work is to resolve the disagreement current in the literature regarding the origins of on. A thorough and systematic treatment of the historical development of on is lacking in the literature, which has given rise to two opposing views in this regard. On the one hand are those that argue that the rise of on in French is due to an imitation of Frankish man ‘one, people’, a form which functions semantically and syntactically in much the same way as on, and also derives historically from a noun meaning ‘a human being, man, person’. On the other hand are those who maintain that on resulted, not from an imitation of Frankish man, but from developments native to Latin. It is argued here that on has its roots not in Frankish but in Latin. Two kinds of evidence are given to support this. The first is geographical: a non-specific reflex of homo has been attested not only in Frankish-contact territory, but also in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, and Provençal. The second is chronological: a non-specific use of homo occurs in Classical and Late Latin texts prior to the first great wave of Germanic invasions into Gaul in the fifth century. Examples are drawn from Classical, Late Latin, and Old Romance texts, as well as from the modern Romance languages.},

	abstract = {This article argues that natural languages have two binding strategies that create two types of bound variable pronouns. Pronouns of the first type, which include local fake indexicals, reflexives, relative pronouns, and PRO, may be born with a "defective" feature set. They can acquire the features they are missing (if any) from verbal functional heads carrying standard X-operators that bind them. Pronouns of the second type, which include long-distance fake indexicals, are born fully specified and receive their interpretations via context-shifting X-operators (Cable 2005). Both binding strategies are freely available and not subject to syntactic constraints. Local anaphora emerges under the assumption that feature transmission and morphophonological spell-out are limited to small windows of operation, possibly the phases of Chomsky 2001. If pronouns can be born underspecified, we need an account of what the possible initial features of a pronoun can be and how it acquires the features it may be missing. The article develops such an account by deriving a space of possible paradigms for referential and bound variable pronouns from the semantics of pronominal features. The result is a theory of pronouns that predicts the typology and individual characteristics of both referential and bound variable pronouns.},

Baseline data were collected using a questionnaire and semistructured interviews; ethnographic methods then shed light on ideologies, attitudes, and the processes of language shift. Availability of interlocutors correlates strongly with fluency, for both native speakers and learners, but the increasing age and linguistic isolation of many native speakers contributes to both individual and societal language loss, along with other factors.

	abstract = {The recognition and proper use of the meanings underlying the English modal verbs are a problem for the student of English as a foreign language even in relatively advanced stages. The problem lies not in the surface positioning of the modals nor in their wide range of meanings, but in associating the right modal with the right meaning. Current research in generative semantics attempts to sketch the logical structures underlying English sentences. The structure is expressed in terms of a central verb and the nouns which accompany it. Tense, negatives, and the modals are added to the structure as higher predicates. These structures reveal differences in the modals. Research on the semantic structure of the modals asks the following questions: (1) Is the modal an epistemic or a root modal? (2) Is the negation of the modal external or internal? (3) Does syntactic past tense coincide with semantic past tense? (4) What kind of a sentence-state, process, or action-does the modal have within its scope? This research deals with the structure of English. It is relevant for the teacher of English in determining what is the content which must be taught. Content is prior to method. Before a teacher can be effective, the teacher must have a thorough understanding of what is to be taught. Only then can the teacher decide what is the best method for communicating what is known about the structure of the language.},

The first objective was to review the use of computational methods in anthropological research focusing on the last 25 years, while the second objective was to explore the potential of the semantic web focusing on existing technologies for ontological representation. For these purposes, the study explores the use of computers in anthropology regarding data processing and data modelling for more effective data processing. The survey reveals that there is an ongoing transition from the instrumentalisation of computers as tools for calculations, to the implementation of information science methodologies for analysis, deduction, knowledge representation, and reasoning, as part of the research process in social anthropology. Finally, it is highlighted that the ecosystem of the semantic web does not subserve quantification and metrics but introduces a new conceptualisation for addressing and meeting research questions in anthropology.},

Regarding the three aspects of attitude i.e., cognitive, behavioral, and emotional, the participants showed negative attitudes towards learning English. On the demographic profile, there were statistically significant attitudinal differences regarding gender and field of study but not year of study. Based on the research findings, some recommendations are finally presented.},

The design of this research was mixed method using explanatory sequential design. To obtain the data, the instrument used was a questionnaire consisting of cognitive, affective and conative components of language attitudes. Interview was carried out to acquire the reason the students had the attitudes. The finding was both HAC and LAC students' language attitudes were mostly positive (91.83\%) in cognitive, affective and conative language attitudes. Some (8.17\%) had different language attitudes. They showed positive language attitudes, but acquired low scores and showed negative language attitudes, but acquired high scores. The interview revealed this phenomenon.},

As intended, this has transformed the linguistic landscape (LL) of Montreal, which looks more French than just three decades ago. But if we stop looking and actually listen to the city's soundscape, what is clear is that Montreal is a much more bilingual and multilingual city with a population increasingly able to read signs both in English and in French. Interestingly, in the Montreal LL can be found a number of commercial signs that are nothing less than wry “bilingual winks” that circumvent legislation, sometimes with quite wicked skill, and play with French and English. These bilingual winks are clearly intended for a population with the language skills to catch the wink and can be interpreted as manifestations of the increasing number of complex language repertoires, but also of a bilingual aesthetic that revels in disrupting and claiming space. It would also seem, however, that while a certain amount of covert bilingual creativity has been inspired by the legal constraints imposed in Québec, bilingual wordplay has simply found ways of creeping into the LL, despite the politics of language and legislation.},

	abstract = {In the United States, increasing access to the internet, the increasing costs of large-scale face-to-face data collections, and the general reluctance of the public to participate in intrusive in-person data collections all mean that new approaches to nationally representative surveys are urgently needed. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for faster, higher-quality alternatives to face-to-face data collection. These trends place a high priority on the evaluation of innovative web-based data collection methods that are convenient for the U.S. public and yield scientific information of high quality. The web mode is particularly appealing because it is relatively inexpensive, it is logistically flexible to implement, and it affords a high level of privacy and confidentiality when correctly implemented. With this study, we aimed to conduct a methodological evaluation of a sequential mixed-mode web/mail data collection protocol, including modular survey design concepts, which was implemented on a national probability sample in the U.S. in 2020-2021. We implemented randomized experiments to test theoretically-informed hypotheses that 1) the use of mail and increased incentives to follow up with households that did not respond to an invitation to complete a household screening questionnaire online would help to recruit different types of households; and 2) the use of modular survey design, which involves splitting a lengthy self-administered survey up into multiple parts that can be completed at a respondent’s convenience, would improve survey completion rates. We find support for the use of mail and increased incentives to follow up with households that have not responded to a web-based screening questionnaire. We did not find support for the use of modular design in this context. Simple descriptive analyses also suggest that attempted telephone reminders may be helpful for the main survey.},

	abstract = {The city of Toulouse is a major contributor to the public visibility of Occitan, a regional language (RL) associated with southern France. Whilst French law recognizes the country's RLs in terms of national heritage, the official supremacy of French remains constitutionally unchallenged. This means that, along with other public texts, street names are only officially sanctioned in French. The bilingual street signs in central Toulouse recognize this hegemony by consistently displaying French above Occitan. However, they also suggest a covert preference for the RL, where Occitan overshadows French in the meaning associations of street names, and their translation and adaptation on the lower plaques. This challenges the linguistic hierarchy as determined by code preference, as Occitan emerges as a dominant code hidden in plain sight. This article proposes several methods for quantifying Occitan vitality as seen on street signs. Based on current notions of code preference and inter-text translation, it offers some new approaches to classifying and analysing multilingual signs in the Linguistic Landscape.},

Using SIGNS, we analyze 30 school neighborhoods in an American Southwest border town and find that wealthier neighborhoods are more likely to have LLs indexed by Spanish than English, and these neighborhoods are subsequently more likely to support bilingual education. This research demonstrates how semiotics, bilingual education, and LL research can together provide for an interdisciplinary approach to better understanding specifically how and why our LLs are implicitly influential.},

	abstract = {In this dissertation, I use a bilingual epistolary corpus to examine the interaction of language contact, language- and genre-specific conventions, and speakers’ individual communicative strategies. Although multilingualism was a common historical condition, many traditional language histories and studies of historical speech only consider monolinguals, or bilingualism as it affects a particular language, rather than seeing multilingualism as part of an individual and community repertoire. In contrast, this study uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the linguistic practices of a bilingual network of speakers in both of their languages. The corpus analyzed here is a collection of private letters which I selected and transcribed from the family correspondence of Francisco Bouligny, a soldier and military governor in colonial New Orleans. These letters were written in both French and Spanish as the family and acquaintances corresponded between New Orleans, France, and Spain for a period spanning from the mid-18th to the mid-19 th century.
I address the following research questions through case studies at three levels: phonological/orthographic, morphosyntactic, and pragmatic. (1) In what way(s) does bilingualism affect language usage? How do bilingual and monolingual usage differ? (2) How does bilingualism interact with other factors such as convention, genre, audience, and stance, and how do bilingual writers use the resources of their two languages in their production?
In Chapter 3, I find widespread orthographic variation conditioned by factors such as age and geographic location. However, I argue for the inclusion of language-specific education and literacy as an additional factor in variation, as I find that the written standard can obscure variation and contact effects while also serving as a resource for bilinguals when writing in a second language. Chapter 4 addresses the contrast between the complex and simple past tenses in both Spanish and French. As the monolingual patterns of use in each language diverge, I find that bilinguals as a group do not follow monolinguals in showing an increased use of the complex past in French but not Spanish. Although individual patterns vary greatly, bilinguals use the French complex past overall less frequently than monolinguals, arguably because of the restraining influence of Spanish contact. This contact influence can be seen in discourse-pragmatic uses of the two tenses, used to shape the narrative or create temporal contrast. In Chapter 5, I consider the construction of identity and interpersonal relationships in bilingual correspondence through choice of language, forms of address, and expressions of sincerity. I find that speakers choose and continue to use only one language with their addressees, even when both speakers are bilingual, and that this choice is motivated largely by the characteristics of the addressee. The choice of second person pronouns (T or V) patterns fairly rigidly according to language and familial relationship, but I argue that speakers vary opening formulae to express more subtle distinctions in the intimacy of the relationship. Some speakers similarly appeal to existing formulae to convince the addressee of their sincerity, but this can be shown to be particularly true of less literate or second-language speakers, while other speakers eschew explicit mentions of sincerity for other strategies. Overall, although speakers show awarenes of epistolary norms in each language and in many ways adhere to language-specific practices, they also manipulate these conventions in meaningful ways.
This study is the first to delve into issues of historical bilingualism through a balanced bilingual epistolary corpus and one of few to explore language use in Spanish Louisiana. I find that individual speakers show evidence of using resources from their bilingual repertoire to aid in composition and construction of meaning in various ways. This is particularly true of loci of variation in the individual language systems or structures that share typological similarities across the systems. However, at the community level the variety of individual patterns and the force of the monolingual norms and written formulae appear to inhibit the spread of change. I underscore the importance in future studies of considering a speaker’s (and community’s) language use in its entire context, including other languages, literacies, and considerations of genre, as we explore how speakers use the available resources for interpersonal communication and how that translates to the community level.},

With what consequences for the speakers whose practices are under scrutiny or under critics?},

	abstract = {This study explores variation in the use of English-origin verbs in Quebec French. These lexical borrowings are usually integrated grammatically into the receiving language (Poplack, 2018), as in il va crasher and elle m’a ghosté in Quebec French. However, a new lexical insertion strategy for English-origin verbs has been observed in the past few years: verbal borrowings can lack overt morphological integration, as in il va crash and elle m’a ghost. This article examines the use of English-origin verbs in Quebec French from a variationist perspective by focusing on 1) possible correlations between speakers and how they evaluate the different lexical insertion strategies, and 2) the social factors that constrain the use of morphologically unintegrated English-origin verbs. Results from quantitative analyses based on 675 participants indicate that young Quebecers from Montreal with a high level of proficiency in English are the ones who use this morphologically unintegrated form the most and evaluate it more positively. This unintegrated form poses a theoretical problem according to Poplack’s (2018) theory, for which nonce borrowings are morphologically and syntactically integrated into the receiving language.},

Contact with the indigenous Isthmus Zapotec language leads to decreased rates of syllable-final /s/ retention, creating a locally salient n+1-order index between “Zapotecness” and /s/ reduction that influences the indexical field for syllable-final /s/ reduction. Zapotec identity is associated with tradition and femininity. Therefore, in this new indexical field, syllable-final /s/ reduction comes to directly index Zapotec language dominance and indirectly index both femininity and tradition. This leads feminine and elderly speakers to reduce /s/ more frequently than “less feminine” and young speakers, even though the opposite pattern is usually found in other varieties. The results show, therefore, that language contact can influence the indexical field typically linked to socially meaningful variation and thereby cause unexpected patterns of variation to emerge.},

The data of this study comes from semi-structured interviews with 11 Indigenous participants in Taiwan. The findings suggest that, when deciding who can ‘do’ language revitalisation, only those who are deemed legitimate by the speakers have the power to act. However, the speakers view the non-Indigenous speakers as potential speakers and, thus, were also assigned language revitalisation responsibility. Thus, by encouraging non-Indigenous speakers to become speakers of an Indigenous language via language acquisition, language ownership is shared. This study shows the complexity of how the speakers negotiate language ownership and how this has an impact on language revitalisation efforts.},

Overextension of the scope of OSPs in contexts where NSs are discursively expected has been consistently observed in different language contact situations, including pairs of null subject languages. According to the Interface Hypothesis, this is a compensatory strategy that occurs on account of bilingualism itself (inefficiency in syntax-pragmatic mappings). The study evaluates the Interface Hypothesis, focusing on the understudied combination of Greek and Spanish, by comparing three types of bilinguals: first-generation immigrants, heritage speakers, and L2 speakers, together with monolingual baseline groups. In addition, the study examines the age effects on speakers’ performance. Five groups of speakers (N = 115; age range 16–87; mean: 50.13, SD = 19.33) performed a self-paced auditory AR task. No overextension of the scope of OSPs was found in any of the bilingual groups, against the predictions stemming from the Interface Hypothesis. Significant age effects were found in the interpretation of NSs by both monolingual and bilingual speakers of Greek.},

Specifically, the speakers of this study favored rising final boundary tones when maintaining their turn and the falling final contours for the end of turn.

The article claims that a major diachronic change has occurred in the syllable structure of Yoruba phonology due to its continued contact with English, resulting in the invention, preservation, and hypercorrection of clusters and codas. I characterize this change in terms of OT constraint re-ranking (Miglio and Moren 2003) and assess the resulting synchronic variation against the indexed constraint approach of Itô and Mester (1995a, b, 1999), the ranked-winners approach of Coetzee (2004), the partial-order co-phonology of Anttila (1997), and the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model of Goldwater and Johnson (2003). I show that none of these approaches is able to account independently for the categorical, gradient, and lexically conditioned variation that characterize the contemporary Yoruba syllable structure, but rather that a MaxEnt model augmented with lexical indexation is the most economical model that fits the Yoruba data accurately., RésuméCet article fournit une description et une analyse dans la théorie de l'optimalité (OT) des changements et de la variation induite par le contact dans la structure syllabique du yoruba contemporain.

Both L1 and L2 groups of university students demonstrated more general complexity in their written summaries than less mature writers. However, the use of phrasal elaboration was apparent just at the upper secondary and university levels with L1 students. Both groups generally tend to overuse causal connectors while underusing additive and adversative connectors compared to the author’s use in the source text. Yet both groups employ significantly more adversative connectors just at the post-secondary level. The only difference observed between L1 and L2 writers was in the diversity of connector words used in the summary, with the former group using a richer, more diverse vocabulary. Several measures for succinctness differentiated L1 and L2 students in early secondary with the latter group condensing the source text less than L1 students. Correlation analysis suggested that many measures of syntactic complexity and connector use are inextricably linked.},

To further test hypotheses put forward in the revised Speech Learning Model (SLM-r: Flege \& Bohn, 2021), that L2 input distribution is associated with L1/L2 phonetic learning, information on L2-learner participants’ L2 dominance was gathered. The results showed clear L1 perceptual drift in a subgroup of L2-learner participants who were NOT nativelike in L2 English /i-ɪ/ categorization but were L2 dominant. The results support the claim that L2 input plays an important role in reorganizing the L1 phonetic system. However, they also highlight the importance of separating L2 dominance related factors (e.g., L2 input/use) and L2 perceptual ability in investigating L1-L2 phonetic interaction.},

However, the influence of constraints caused by the medium of communication on alignment remains unexplored. In this paper, we look at structural alignment in face-to-face and synchronous text-based communication. In our study, we analysed the influence of different factors on structural alignment in two datasets, one of computer-mediated conversation and the other of spoken conversations, and found that the likelihood of structural alignment in both cases is determined by the same factors. However, when comparing the overall magnitude of structural alignment in the two datasets, we found a greater magnitude of structural alignment in text-based conversations. In our view, this result suggests that structural alignment is used to trade off the constraints of the text-based medium.},

We chart such change in acoustic data from seven generations of White speakers (n = 135) in the Southeastern state of Georgia. We analyze front vowels affected by both the SVS and LBMS (dress, trap), plus price and face, known respectively to monophthongize and centralize in the SVS, and LBMS-implicated lot/thought. The SVS is most advanced among Georgians born in the mid-twentieth century, particularly in face-centralization. In Generation X, retraction of front lax vowels begins, leading toward the LBMS. These results, which hold across genders and education levels, support findings that regional vowel systems declined precipitously following a Gen X “cliff,” raising questions about how such language changes are rooted in demographic transformations of that time period.},

Results show a shift from the favored variant wer in Old English to man in Middle English, with the diachronic change in frequency following a prototypical s-shaped distribution. Although the replacement seems to take centuries to be complete, lexical frequency and written transmission are proposed as influential explanatory factors, and a homonymic clash is suggested to have accelerated the process of replacement in Middle English. Text type and text origin contribute to variation, with alliteration significantly influencing lexical choices in Old English verse texts. When combined with findings from recent synchronic work, this study highlights a heterogeneously structured semantic domain, which has undergone lexical replacement and change over time, providing some evidence for the applicability of s-shaped patterns for lexical change.},

The results of the analysis of 39,397 tokens of content words from 1,232 word types in English display a significant effect for a word's ratio of conditioning in speaker-relative fast speech, although the effect size is small or very small. Other variables shown in the literature to condition speech rate also significantly condition speech rate here.

Drawing on ethnographic data of two telling cases, it explores how minoritized students’ subjectivities were linked to neoliberal discourses of English and constituted by power techniques, self-technologies, and affective dispositions embedded in wider institutional transformations. Participants were found experiencing a shift to the individualistic subjectivity associated with academic achievement and performance in English away from the collective identity of “authentic Uyghur” symbolized by the Uyghur language. Two salient discourses of English, i.e., English as constraints, and English as academic excellence, emerging from the neoliberal-oriented institutional English language education policies and practices, shaped the participants either as incompetent English learners or elite subjects. Participants learned to responsibilitize themselves through such self-technologies as confession and preaching, and affective practices. Yet, technologies of hope and optimism became for a few the enjoyment of experiences and performance of elitism while projecting a majority disadvantaged as affectively problematic others. The self-technologies and affective responses without recognition of larger structures of inequality could further reinforce the neoliberal logic. The affective labor of sense of solidarity, commitment to community, empathy for the deprived ones with critical reflection and collective action, nevertheless, may counter neoliberal logic and point to an alternative path to meaning-making and social relations.},

We examine whether a division of labor exists in the use of quotative frames, and whether the rise of first-person-marked internal thought reporting attested in settler colonial Englishes is present in AE.Our statistical modeling shows functional partitioning in how quotative frames are used, with AE speakers strongly encoding direct speech across time. We find that the rise of first-person-marked internal thought reporting has not been systemic in AE. Despite be like's incursion after 1983, the underlying system of AE has not changed.

	abstract = {Talker variability has been reported to facilitate generalization and retention of speech learning, but is also shown to place demands on cognitive resources. Our recent study provided evidence that phonetically-irrelevant acoustic variability in single-talker (ST) speech is sufficient to induce equivalent amounts of learning to the use of multiple-talker (MT) training. This study is a follow-up contrasting MT versus ST training with varying degrees of temporal exaggeration to examine how cognitive measures of individual learners may influence the role of input variability in immediate learning and long-term retention. Native Chinese-speaking adults were trained on the English /i/-/ɪ/ contrast. We assessed the trainees’ working memory and inhibition control before training. The two trained groups showed comparable long-term retention of training effects in terms of word identification performance and more native-like cue weighting in both perception and production regardless of talker variability condition. The results demonstrate the role of phonetically-irrelevant variability in robust speech learning and modulatory functions of nonlinguistic domain-general inhibitory control and working memory, highlighting the necessity to consider the interaction between input characteristics, task difficulty, and individual differences in cognitive abilities in assessing learning outcomes.},

Multilayer networks provide the framework to capture the complexity typical of systems of systems, enabling the analysis of biophysical, social and human-made networks from an integrated perspective. Here I review the most important theoretical developments in the past decade, showing how the layered structure of multilayer networks is responsible for phenomena that cannot be observed from the analysis of subsystems in isolation or from their aggregation, including enhanced diffusion, emergent mesoscale organization and phase transitions. I discuss applications spanning multiple spatial scales, from the cell to the human brain and to ecological and social systems, and offer perspectives and challenges on future research directions.},

On the basis of these demographics as well as some textual evidence it is argued that despite theoretical predictions to the contrary, a Creole language did emerge and 'jell' in situ in the period 1719-1770. Instrumental in the creation of this language, which was spoken in settlements along the Mississippi River, were those African slaves who had arrived 1719-1731. Demographics also sugges that the Creole spoken to the west of the Atchafalaya River, unsettled until the 1760s, was the product of a semi-separate genesis. An examination of the relativization strategies of modern representatives of the two Creoles (PC and BB) in addition to the number of differences noted by Klingler (1992) suggest that this was indeed the case.},

	abstract = {This study examines how a historical, multilingual space is written and constructed, thus questioning monolingual French language ideology. Two cemeteries in Menton, next to the Italian border on the French Riviera, were visited and documented. The presence of Italian is clearly observable, because of the historic proximity to Italy. But also many other languages are represented, such as for example English, Russian, Polish or German: the city also has a history of being a therapeutic town where many foreigners spent time to recover or stayed because of a mild climate. This is also reflected in the linguistic landscape of the cemeteries. Building on the notions of space/place and of heterotopia, the cemeteries are examined from a qualitative, interpretative perspective. Iconicity in writing and script choice is discussed, as well as multilingualism both on cemetery level, and as pertaining to individual tombstones. The construction of linguistic spaces is examined. The results show that other national languages in the cemeteries do not challenge national French as such. However, graves of African soldiers may still question France’s colonial history and the presence of Occitan can be seen as a reminder of a former vernacular.},

This article aimed to simulate the propagation of disinformation in social networks derived from the diplomacy strategy, based on the elements of the system. The main research question that was opened up was how do the elements of disinformation derived from the social media diplomacy strategy interact to affect a susceptible population? For the design of the simulation model, system dynamics was used as the main technique in the re-search methodology in conjunction with statistical analysis. Five computational simulations were run for the adoption methods of susceptible and uninformed population, misinformation techniques and echo chamber. The model developed found that the diplomacy disinformation agent is able to spread its message efficiently through the bot outreach mechanism and only a part of the susceptible population unsubscribes to the disinformation agent’s account. Significant differences were identified in the absence of paid outreach, bots and trolls in the propagation of information, and in the variation in the timing of disinformation propagation. Consequently, the developed model allows the understanding of the problem of disinformation as a strategy of diplomacy from international rather than local dynamics, as well as the effects of the use of each element in the system.},

In the process, already existing elements of a language are recombined or linguistic material from other languages is borrowed. But are borrowed neologisms accepted similarly well by the speech community as neologisms that were formed from “native” material? We investigate this question based on neologisms in German. Building on the corresponding results of a corpus study, we test the hypothesis of whether “native” neologisms are more readily accepted than those borrowed from English. To do so, we use a psycholinguistic experimental paradigm that allows us to estimate the degree of uncertainty of the participants based on the mouse trajectories of their responses. Unexpectedly, our results suggest that the neologisms borrowed from English are accepted more frequently, more quickly, and more easily than the “native” ones. These effects, however, are restricted to people born after 1980, the so-called millenials. We propose potential explanations for this mismatch between corpus results and experimental data and argue, among other things, for a reinterpretation of previous corpus studies.},

	abstract = {Learning sound categories is central to language acquisition – but we know little about the extent of phonetic variability in the learner’s input. In this study, we phonetically annotated coronal segments (/t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, and /n/) in a corpus of naturalistic American English infant-directed speech (IDS). We did not find evidence that IDS is consistently more canonical than adult-directed speech (ADS), challenging the notion of IDS as a learning register. While IDS is not more canonical than ADS overall, the canonical form was nonetheless the most frequent form in IDS for all segments except /t/. We also considered how infants may move beyond the task of identifying the canonical form to how they may learn to cluster allophones; for this purpose, we quantified the dissimilarity in the phonological environments of the variants in question. Lastly, we investigated a case in which the overwhelming majority of instantiations were not canonical – word-final t and d – and demonstrated that morphologically-conditioned suffixes were more canonical than other word final segments. This corpus is a vital step towards understanding how infants can learn to categorize sounds from their input and will be an invaluable tool for future sociolinguistic, computational and theoretical modeling of language learning.},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives: Code-switching and calquing are two widespread language contact phenomena in bilingual speech. While both phenomena have been discussed extensively in research on language contact in the past decades, only very few studies systematically investigate code-switching and calquing of and within multiword units or constructions. In our contribution, we aim at developing a more differentiated account of code-switching and calquing of and within multiword units and constructions, bringing together recent usage-based psycholinguistic and Construction Grammar theories and modeling with cognitively oriented approaches to language contact and bilingualism.
Design: We analyze and discuss corpus data from the Corpus of Spanish in Southern Arizona (CESA) from first-, second-, and third-generation bilingual Spanish–English speakers in Arizona.
Data and analysis: The corpus analysis focuses on code-switching and calquing of and within N Prep N, NN(N), and Adj N/N Adj patterns (N = noun, Prep = preposition, Adj = adjective).
Findings/conclusions: The analysis highlights the importance of both lexically specific multiword units and partially and fully schematic constructions in code-switching and calquing as well as a continuum between constructions situated closer to the lexical or to the syntactic pole.
Originality: Whereas multiword sequences have been found to play an important role in (mostly first language [L1]) acquisition, use, and processing, the role of multiword units and constructions in bilingual speech has been much less studied so far.
Significance/implications: The study shows that both lexically specific constructions or multiword units as well as partially or fully schematic constructions play a central role in code-switching and calquing. The study argues that code-switching and calquing may ultimately be viewed as a continuum, since the speakers rely on similar, highly frequent, and productive constructions and their interlingual correspondences for both phenomena.},

By means of a matched-guise test, we explore French-English bilinguals’ social evaluations of the three linguistic varieties and examine how these social evaluations vary according to participant characteristics (i.e. age, gender, mother tongue, origin, and sociocultural identity). In our experiment, participants listened to a speaker using Manitoban French, Canadian English and code-switching and rated each guise on several solidarity and status traits. Results from the cumulative link mixed effects models reveal that French and English are rated similarly for status. Overall, both French and English elicit feelings of attachment, but a preference towards French emerges among participants born in Manitoba. Code-switching is rated lower than the monolingual varieties in most status and solidarity traits, which indicates that our participants implicitly value linguistic purism. However, results also show that participants born in Manitoba and those with French as their mother tongue ascribe covert prestige to code-switching.},

While proficiency in the home language varied across the children, most parents valued the transmission of their home language. Practices that supported the transmission of the home language included the use of home language with their children, opportunities to use the home language in the community context, and the importance of the home language for the child. In addition, we observed that many children in the study had parents who spoke the same home language as a first language(s), and had siblings who used this language at home. Strategies adapted to the needs of different profiles within multilingual families could be employed to support the transmission and maintenance of the minoritized language.},

	abstract = {During the 2020 US presidential election, conspiracy theories about large-scale voter fraud were widely circulated on social media platforms. Given their scale, persistence, and impact, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms that caused these theories to spread. The aim of this preregistered study was to investigate whether retweet frequencies among proponents of voter fraud conspiracy theories on Twitter during the 2020 US election are consistent with frequency bias and/or content bias. To do this, we conducted generative inference using an agent-based model of cultural transmission on Twitter and the VoterFraud2020 dataset. The results show that the observed retweet distribution is consistent with a strong content bias causing users to preferentially retweet tweets with negative emotional valence. Frequency information appears to be largely irrelevant to future retweet count. Follower count strongly predicts retweet count in a simpler linear model but does not appear to drive the overall retweet distribution after temporal dynamics are accounted for. Future studies could apply our methodology in a comparative framework to assess whether content bias for emotional valence in conspiracy theory messages differs from other forms of information on social media.},

CPF could have significantly changed hunter–gatherers’ spatial use and mobility, altered social networks and increased opportunities for information-exchange. We evaluated whether CPF patterns facilitate information-transmission and considered the potential roles of environmental conditions, mobility strategies and population sizes. We built an agent-based model of CPF where agents moved according to a simple optimal foraging rule, and could encounter other agents as they moved across the environment. They either foraged close to their home within a given radius or moved the location of their home to new areas. We analysed the interaction networks arising under different conditions and found that, at intermediate levels of environmental heterogeneity and mobility, CPF increased global and local network efficiencies as well as the rate of contagion-based information-transmission. We also found that central-place mobility strategies can further improve information transmission in larger populations. Our findings suggest that the combination of foraging and movement strategies, as well as the environmental conditions that characterized early human societies, may have been a crucial precursor in our species’ unique capacity to innovate, accumulate and rely on complex culture.},

To describe such interdependencies, researchers often invoke the metaphor of a “network of identities.” However, sociology currently lacks a cohesive body of research that moves beyond the metaphor to actually conceptualizing, measuring, and studying identity structures as networks, thus missing the potential benefits of this approach. In this article, we take a networks-based approach to capture identity structures and operationalize key concepts in the identities literature. We use identity theory to derive hypotheses that link well-being with the prevalence and intensity of interference and facilitation among identities. Using original survey data, we find that both the prevalence and intensity of facilitatory and interfering relationships among identities are associated with various well-being outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of identity networks to advance multiple areas of sociological work.},

French and MC, although related, show significant typological divergences on some specific features, e.g. the order between noun and definite determiner in the noun phrase, or the use of a linker to mark a possessive embedded noun phrase. In this paper, I explore the possible combination of the different values of these features in mixed noun phrases occurring in corpora. I inquire about the possible parameters which may influence the outcome and explain the relative frequencies of these different combinations. It appears that there is a partially common pool of elementary structures. Many utterances fall into the category termed by Muysken (2000) ‘congruent lexicalization’. I also observe that apparent complex double embeddings have an internal logic, as they result from adjunction of multi-word modifiers. Finally I propose a model which accounts for the observed occurrences by postulating a level in the speech generation process where language itself is underspecified, and where it is in a position to be specified on the fly by contextual factors, coming either from the lexicon or from the constructional frame.},

However, various facets of implicit-explicit discrepancies (IEDs) remain underexplored – particularly, how prevalent the potentially distinct categories of IEDs are. Existing models speak mainly to discrepancies that occur because explicit attitudes are less prejudiced than implicit attitudes and tends to assume other possible categories are trivial. Using data from two large samples, this study provides a descriptive analysis of the different ways IEDs exist regarding racial attitudes among U.S. Whites. Results suggest IEDs exist largely in line with traditional theories, but there is substantial variation yet to be understood. These results were robust across a variety of measures, although decision-making in the construction of measures can be consequential. Future research should consider this variation in theory development regarding implicit versus explicit attitude measures.},

	abstract = {A superhumanization bias involves attribution of qualities that are beyond human to a certain group. Waytz and colleagues reported evidence supporting this bias among White Americans wherein Black targets were perceived as more capable of possessing superhuman qualities than White targets. We sought to better understand the nature of this effect by using different response scales (forced choice vs. Likert) and instruction sets (supporting vs. not supporting existence of superhuman abilities). Results across three studies replicate the superhumanization effect and demonstrate the necessity of several key methodological features; however, under the most realistic survey conditions (i.e. allowing unbiased decisions, being truthful about the existence of such abilities), no significant superhumanization bias emerged. Additionally, in conditions with significant bias, the size of the effect was relatively small, suggesting that this bias may not be as widespread as previously believed; indeed, only a minority of participants showed superhumanization in the predicted direction. Findings support the importance of exploring how arbitrary methodological decisions change inferences about psychological phenomena in the population.},

Across two studies, criterion overlap percentages were computed using national datasets and separate participant samples estimated prejudice overlap. Results indicate that beliefs about the generalized nature of prejudice can improve accuracy by reducing faulty underestimation of the overlap in anti-Black racism and sexism. In addition to greater displayed accuracy in perceptions of prototypical perpetrators of prejudice (i.e., estimates of White men compared to White women), the present work suggests that accuracy is improved when estimating sexist attitudes from racist attitudes, rather than vice versa. Together, this work documents the accuracy of prejudice overlap perceptions, for the first time, and factors that facilitate accuracy (i.e., perpetrator prototypicality, known prejudicial attitude), with implications for intergroup dynamics research.},

This research examined if and how threat-related COVID-19 misinformation is diffused more actively than the ones concerning the efficacy of protective actions. Further, it explored the mechanisms underlying the diffusion of threat- and efficacy-related misinformation by testing the mediating capacities of the three key drivers of information diffusion– novelty, emotional arousal, and message credibility. Results of multilevel analyses of online survey data (N = 1012) employing a national quota sample in South Korea showed that threat-related misinformation was diffused more than efficacy-related misinformation. Furthermore, multilevel path models specifying the three key drivers as mediators indicated that the effects of threat-related misinformation on social sharing were explained by greater perceptions of novelty and emotional arousal. Message credibility, however, mediated the effects on sharing intention for those who have not been exposed to a given misinformation but not actual sharing behavior upon exposure, suggesting that the latter may be influenced more by arousal-based responses (e.g., emotional arousal) than sound reasoning (e.g., message credibility). Implications on interventions aiming at curbing health misinformation diffusion are discussed.},

Building on the identity centrality literature, we examined how multiple aspects of Native identification uniquely shaped attitudes toward mascots. While Native Americans in our sample generally opposed Native mascots, especially the Redskins, attitudes varied according to demographic characteristics (e.g., age, political orientation, education) and the strength of participants’ racial–ethnic identification. Specifically, stronger Native identification (behavioral engagement and identity centrality) predicted greater opposition. Results highlight the importance of considering the unique and multifaceted aspects of identity, particularly when seeking to understand Native people’s attitudes and experiences.},

Researchers interested in understanding the achievement gap generally seek to find the mechanisms that can explain why Black students continue to achieve at lower levels than their White counterparts. This research has shown that differences in socioeconomic status, family cultural resources, school quality and racial composition, and bias and prejudice in schools all act as mechanisms that link race to academic achievement. In this paper, we review studies from the past 10 years on the academic achievement gap. We argue that while all of the factors identified in the literature can add insight to how race structures educational achievement, the fundamental cause of the achievement gap is structural racism, a system of social organization that privileges White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color. We argue that acknowledging structural racism as the fundamental cause of the achievement gap can provide a unifying framework for interpreting findings from studies of specific mechanisms link race to academic outcomes.},

Furthermore, by examining the rate at which stopped drivers were searched and the likelihood that searches turned up contraband, we found evidence that the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for searching white drivers. Finally, we found that legalization of recreational marijuana reduced the number of searches of white, black and Hispanic drivers—but the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was still lower than that for white drivers post-legalization. Our results indicate that police stops and search decisions suffer from persistent racial bias and point to the value of policy interventions to mitigate these disparities.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Verbal fluency (VF) tasks are an efficient tool for exploring lexical retrieval. Attriters generally produce fewer words in semantic categories than monolinguals, but the processes underlying attriters’ lexical retrieval remain unclear. Phonemic tasks are scarcely applied in language attrition studies. We aim to identify processes underlying attriters’ phonemic verbal fluency (PVF) and semantic verbal fluency (SVF) performance by extending the analysis beyond total scores in the first (L1) and second (L2) language.
Design: We modeled total scores and temporal aspects of task performance in L1 and L2 for the attriters, with L1 use and length of residence (LoR) as predictors. We analyzed the number and types of errors between languages and compared L1 task performance with a matched monolingual group.
Data and analysis: Attriters’ (N = 38) phonemic and semantic task performance in L1 (Finnish) and L2 (English) were modeled, and results were contrasted to a matched monolingual control group (N = 50).
Findings: Attriters demonstrated strong proficiency in L1 and similar lexical retrieval processes in L1 and L2 after 20 years of immersive L2 exposure. Frequent L1 use supported overall performance but slowed performance down in both languages. Compared with monolinguals, attriters show a disadvantage in SVF, but not due to slower initiation. Instead, attriters rely more on rapid L1 retrieval than monolinguals.
Originality: Prior research on VF tasks in language attrition populations has mainly focused on SVF total scores in L1. Our investigation explores underlying mechanisms of L1 and L2 task performance in PVF and SVF within a language attrition population and contrasts L1 performance to a matched monolingual group performance.
Implications: This study demonstrates the importance of investigating L2 alongside L1 in language attrition studies for a holistic approach to language processing strategies. Our findings enhance understanding of the processes underlying VF task performance, emphasizing the significance of VF task early-stage performance.},

We probe into practices and perceptions of one designated ethnic minority group in China across domains of family, community and education through a process of authentication. Drawing on a questionnaire of 576 students with local, multilingual education experience and interviews with 48 students of the Zhuang minority group, we examine the intersubjectivities of language, ethnicity and Chineseness. The findings highlight an unwavering affirmation of Putonghua (PTH) dominance as central to Chineseness along with wavering support of Zhuang and other minority languages or dialects as linked to ethnicity and regional identity. Crucially, our data show that the policies and ideologies around recognised minority languages can make it difficult for speakers to name or claim their ‘mother tongue’. The analyses suggest that ‘mother tongue’ is a misnomer in many ways as it is not primordial, matrilineal or geneological but is based in (primarily monolingual) ideologies which do not adequately represent multilingual individuals and communities. We propose a conceptual framework to expand our understanding of the authentication of mother tongue and the resilience of minority/minoritised language, problematised by monolingual ideologies.},

Social information, such as a speaker’s perceived race or ethnicity, can also affect the processing of the speech signal, in some cases facilitating perception (“social priming”). We aimed to replicate and extend this line of inquiry, examining effects of multiple social primes (i.e., a Middle Eastern, White, or East Asian face, or a control silhouette image) on the perception of Mandarin Chinese-accented English and Arabic-accented English. By including uncommon priming combinations (e.g., a Middle Eastern prime for a Mandarin accent), we aimed to test the specificity of social primes: For example, can a Middle Eastern face facilitate perception of both Arabic-accented English and Mandarin-accented English? Contrary to our predictions, our results indicated no facilitative social priming effects for either of the second language (L2) accents. Results for our examination of specificity were mixed. Trends in the data indicated that the combination of an East Asian prime with Arabic accent resulted in lower accuracy as compared with a White prime, but the combination of a Middle Eastern prime with a Mandarin accent did not (and may have actually benefited listeners to some degree). We conclude that the specificity of priming effects may depend on listeners’ level of familiarity with a given accent and/or racial/ethnic group and that the mixed outcomes in the current work motivate further inquiries to determine whether social priming effects for L2-accented speech may be smaller than previously hypothesized and/or highly dependent on listener experience.},

	shorttitle = {From {Ey} to {Ze}},
	abstract = {It is sometimes assumed by cisgender speakers that that the genderqueer/nonbinary use of gender-neutral pronouns is a non-naturalistic imposition on language. This accords with general social attitudes that characterize transgender and nonbinary individuals' gender expressions as unnatural, deceptive, and aggressive. The dissertation tests this assumption by examining both the nonbinary intracommunity norms surrounding pronouns, through a usage survey, and the broader population's interaction with them, through a processing/production task.In the usage survey, singular they was far and away the most common, again reinforcing its dominance in English-speaking spaces. However, other neutral pronouns were also selected, and participants often used them for language play purposes as well as gender expression. Assertion, correction, and respect for pronouns varied heavily based on whether participants had a high or low degree of agency over the company they were keeping.
In the processing and production task, familiarity with GQNB people and pronouns was found overall to correlate with the number of correct answers in the production of gender-neutral pronouns. It is possible that emotional and political affiliation with GQNB people provides motivation to acquire these forms. However, it did not impact processing. Singular they and animate it were as easy to process as binary-gendered pronouns, while neopronouns were more difficult to both process and produce. However, they were not as difficult as nonparadigmatic nonce pronouns, suggesting that the tendency for neopronouns to analogize existing pronoun paradigms helps make them easier to use.
Overall, the textual history and pressures acting on gender-neutral pronouns conform to existing trajectories of pronoun change, suggesting that, while sometimes conscious, these changes  are naturalistic. That cisgender speakers with GQNB friends and family can adopt these uses suggests that exposure can help adult speakers adopt the forms. Because the majority of participants have been adults during the span of time that this change has occurred, the adoption of the form supports the usage-based theory of language change.},

	abstract = {Much of the contemporary scholarship on Black identities focuses on how multiraciality, immigrant status, class, and neighborhood characteristics shape how social actors negotiate identities. In contrast, little analysis exists of how internal migration and regional origin or ancestry shape such negotiations. The study addresses this gap using interview data to examine how U.S.-born Black Louisianans with Creole heritage, who moved to Los Angeles along with their children during the Great Migration, actively negotiate racial/ethnic identities. The results show that participants negotiate identities situationally, especially when ambiguous appearances or surnames trigger interactional encounters in which they are mis-placed as “foreign” to the United States. Specifically, as migrants from one internal U.S. region to another, they use geographical references to situate Black racial and Creole ethnic identities (e.g., they refer to Louisiana or New Orleans) when interacting with non-Creole African Americans and non-Black people in Los Angeles. The study extends prior research on heterogeneous Black identities by demonstrating how internal migration, mixed racial/ethnic ancestry, and region of origin influence native-born Black American identities.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the pronominal system of Louisiana French, a variety of French spoken mainly in the south-western part of Louisiana State.
The analysis of data (Girard Lomheim, 2016) shows that although Louisiana French clitics share certain features with clitics from other informal varieties of French and dialects of French, they cannot be analysed along quite the same lines. They have reached a more advanced stage of grammaticalization. They are moving away from the status of syntactic argument towards the status of agreement marker. The fact that they are subject to strong phonetic erosion and have been gradually replaced by weak pronouns shows that they are coming closer to the ultimate stadium of their grammaticalization cycle (van Gelderen, 2011), the null stadium.
The progressive reduction of the clitic paradigm is accompanied by the emergence of a new class of weak pronouns, which leads us to claim that the pronominal system of this vernacular is organized in three classes of pronouns: strong pronouns and two classes of deficient pronouns:\&nbsp;weak pronouns\&nbsp;and\&nbsp;clitics\&nbsp;in the terms of Cardinaletti et Starke (1994 and 1999). We claim that the difference between strong and weak pronouns should be addressed in terms of syntax and morphology whereas the difference between weak pronouns and clitics should be accounted for in terms of morphosyntax and phonology.

First, how Louisiana vowels differ from or are similar to the reported patterns of Southern dialect were examined. Then, within-dialect differences across regions in Louisiana were examined. Thirty-four female adult monolingual speakers of American English from Louisiana, ranging in age from 18 to 23, produced English monosyllabic words containing 11 vowels /i, ɪ, e, ɛ, æ, ʌ, u, ʊ, o, ɔ, ɑ/. The first two formant frequencies at the midpoint of the vowel nucleus, direction, and amount of formant changes across three different time points (20, 50, and 80\%), and vowel duration were compared to previously reported data on Southern vowels. Overall, Louisiana vowels showed patterns consistent with previously reported characteristics of Southern vowels that reflect ongoing changes in the Southern dialect (no evidence of acoustic reversal of tense-lax pairs, more specifically no peripheralization of front vowels). Some dialect-specific patterns were also observed (a relatively lesser degree of formant changes and slightly shorter vowel duration). These patterns were consistent across different regions within Louisiana.},

Called a boucherie, this activity continues in the state’s rural southwest and is deeply linked to present-day Creole identity. Collected through ethnographic and archival methods, this research argues that the boucherie gives spatial expression to Creole culture through reuniting family members, sharing intergenerational wisdom and memories, and, for some, meeting sustenance needs. I draw from research on black placemaking—conceptualized as the ways black Americans “create sites of endurance, belonging, and resistance through social interaction,” (Hunter and others 2016, 1)—ritualized commemorative practices, and spatializing culture. This study contributes to the burgeoning field of black geographies by demonstrating how boucheries serve culture-sustaining roles for black Louisianans.},

	title = {Rethinking decreolization: {Language} contact and change in {Louisiana} {Creole}},
	shorttitle = {Rethinking decreolization},
	abstract = {All languages change. Creoles are no exception. However, do creoles change in the same ways as other languages? Research on language change in creoles has hinged on the notion of decreolization: apparently a ‘special case’ of contact-induced change whereby the creole adverges to the lexifier (Bickerton 1980). Decreolization has been characterized as ‘an insecure notion: insufficiently distinguished from ordinary change processes, possibly conceptually incoherent, and certainly not adequately supported by diachronic investigations to date’ (Patrick 1999:19, see also Aceto 1999, Russell 2015, Siegel 2010). This study tests whether decreolization can truly be distinguished from ‘ordinary’ change processes in non-creole languages and, crucially, brings diachronic corpus data to bear on this major gap in our understanding of language contact, change and creoles. These data are drawn from Louisiana Creole, a critically endangered and under-researched French-lexifier creole. Louisiana Creole is particularly well-suited to a study of decreolization: over the course of its life, it has been in contact with its lexifier (French) and a more distantly related language (English). This allows a comparative study of the outcomes of contact between the creole and its lexifier (i.e. Louisiana Creole-French contact) and a dominant language which is not its lexifier (i.e. Louisiana Creole-English contact). Further, different varieties of Louisiana Creole have had differing levels of contact over their history: the variety spoken along the Bayou Teche is typically described as heavily decreolized as a result of contact with French as well as being heavily influenced by English (Neumann 1985a); the variety spoken along the Mississippi river, from which the former variety developed, has had relatively less contact with French (Klingler 2003a). Additionally, this thesis demonstrates that Louisiana’s long history of racial segregation has significantly impacted the sociolinguistic dynamics in the region, with LC undergoing differing levels of contact with French on either side of the Jim Crow divide. Data on the morphosyntactic, phonological and lexical consequences of language contact are drawn from a purpose-built diachronic corpus containing 19th-century folklore texts, 20th-century language documentation materials as well as a transcribed subsample of some 50 hours of sociolinguistic interviews conducted in early 2017. In addition, a corpus of Facebook data is used analyze the language of the burgeoning online language revitalization community. Ultimately, this thesis finds that contact-induced change in Louisiana Creole does not proceed in a creole-specific fashion. It is therefore argued that language contact and change in creole languages is better characterized through existing theoretical frameworks and not through the creole-specific notion of decreolization. The intention of this thesis is not to dismiss decades of work on decreolization; rather, this thesis demonstrates that work on decreolization can be integrated into a non-creole-specific account of language contact, variation and change and so contribute to our understanding of the universal factors which modulate these phenomena.},

Rote memorization consists of memorizing the first language (L1) translation of a new L2 word by rehearsal. Semantic mapping displays L1 words conceptually related to the L2 word in a diagram. The keyword method involves associating the novel L2 word with an L1 keyword that is acoustically or orthographically similar, and then connecting the L1 keyword with the L1 translation of the L2 word. The results reveal that vocabulary learning techniques requiring deeper processing through form and meaning associations (i.e., the keyword method) yield the best retention. In addition, rote memorization of L1–L2 equivalents is more effective than creating multiple meaning associations (i.e., semantic mapping). We suggest that using the keyword method with phonological keywords and direct L1 keyword-translation links in the classroom leads to better L2 vocabulary learning at early stages of acquisition.},

We look at signage from private enterprise (i.e. shops and restaurants) and compare them to the public signage on government buildings. We examine the tension between the micro-language policy (the personal and individual language choice rights) and the macro-language policy as stated in national/regional language policies. This study reveals different linguistic landscape patterns: public signs – Indonesian language, Javanese language, and English; private signs – Indonesian language, English and other foreign languages (Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin). By building on the linguistic landscape constructs, we argue that the language choice is not arbitrary. Thus, throughout the paper, we argue that linguistic landscape is an effective mechanism to revive the local languages at risk, in this case Javanese.},

The paper offers substantial evidence to challenge the public and private or from-above and from-below dichotomy paradigm, and proposes a new category of “public-private dual discourse signage” in-between as a complement to the conventional categorization scheme. In the new system, two major types, namely mixing signage and hybrid signage are divided, and four subtypes are further elaborated, with samples discussed in detail. General background research and sociolinguistic studies such as geosemiotic and multimodal analysis are carried out to reveal the multiple driving forces behind the dual discourse signs. It is discovered that the signs’ ownership structure and operation modes are crucial in explaining the complex phenomenon, longitudinal data draws distinctive trajectories and patterns for different subtypes of dual discourse signage. Furthermore, the practical implications and a possible shared future of harmony for the dual discourse signs is discussed.},

Verticalization is anchored in community structure, a focus of this chapter and book, along with how such structure connects down to social networks, families, and individuals. The theoretical section reviews key previous applications of the theory to shift situations and reviews how verticalization is developed in this volume.},

	abstract = {This paper carefully describes African American relative clauses and the range of structures that favor zero subject relatives. Several scholars have suggested that existential sentences and predicate nominatives are not relative clauses. Given the prevalence of existential sentences and predicate nominatives in numerous studies, whether zero subject relatives exist in African American English is questionable. However, this paper avoids the debate to determine whether existential or predicate nominatives involve relativization. Instead, this article looks at other constructions that correlate with zero subject relative in AAE, namely resumption. A thorough examination reveals that relative clauses with these constructions align with typical relative clauses with overt relativizers. The syntax of African American English must compensate for the absence of the relativizer, and it uses two strategies to do so; the first is (1) resumption, and the second is (2) intonation. When zero subject relatives appear bare, relying only on intonation, where rising intonation marks the end of the relative clause and the left edge of the main clause, there is potential for ambiguity. Last, this manuscript shows that the syntax utilizes resumption to avoid parsing errors and resolve structural ambiguities that could potentially result in garden-path sentences.},

The present study draws from the Digital Archive of Southern Speech (Kretzschmar et al. 2013), a database of 64 linguistic interviews collected 1970-1983, to analyze the distribution of [hw] and [w] across social and linguistic variables within a time and place where [hw] was still common. Results reveal that while all speakers exhibited variation between [hw] and [w], with content words exhibiting [hw] at higher rates than function words, intra-speaker variation remained stable across apparent time for White speakers, suggesting that the wine-whine merger had not yet reached the US South. However, [hw] use sharply declined among Black speakers over the same period, demonstrating a divergence from the local White varieties corresponding to a changing cultural landscape. Variation in [hw] also occurs across sub-regions of the South. Finally, college-educated speakers were more likely to use [hw], suggesting that this variable should be interpreted as a prestige feature that persisted in the South.},

These figures are of particular interest because their public and constructed usages may also illuminate wider social usages and indices of specific linguistic variables. This paper presents results from analyses of multiple aspects of ethnolinguistic variation in the speech of Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2019-2020 Democratic Party Primary debates. In particular, it focuses on her use of selected morphosyntactic features associated with African American Language (AAL), vowel systems associated with California and African American identities, and topic-based differences in the use of selected prosodic variables. Together, these results show how VP Harris selectively employs both enregistered and subtle linguistic variables in the establishment of a highly specific sociolinguistic identity that comports with her unique positions politically, socially, and racially. The results of this study expand our knowledge about how the complexities of speaker identity are reflected in sociolinguistic variation, while further illuminating how speakers in the public sphere use variation reflect and construct both who they are and who we want them to be.},

These similarities have been argued to be the result of 19th-century dialect contact between residents of the two cities. This paper examines the palm vowel in New Orleans and argues that it too shows evidence of diffusion from New York around this time period. Words of the palm lexical set that have been part of the English lexicon since before the 19th century, such as father and calm, are found to be merged with the thought phoneme in New Orleans, while more recent palm words such as garage are merged with lot. A handful of traditional lot words, such as John and god, are also sporadically attested with the thought phoneme. Since traditional New York City English also possesses a palm vowel backer than lot, with words such as John and god variably included in it—a pattern that is not widely found in other dialects closely connected to New Orleans English—the findings are interpreted as further evidence for dialect diffusion from New York to New Orleans.},

Latinxs’ use of AAE historically and in the present day, and in a range of contexts, suggests that AAE features acquired through peer socialization are an enduring part of the local Latinx linguistic repertoire. Results add insight into English language learners’ bilingual repertoire formation in contact situations where minority groups are the local majority and highlight the importance of peer interaction and play in educational contexts as part of language and dialect acquisition more broadly. Findings underscore the inadequacy of linguistic ideologies that assume a one-to-one correlation between language or language variety and ethnocultural identity. The Latinx children are not crossing; rather, their use of AAE appears to be normalized in line with language sharing as part of community socialization.},

Findings reveal MHIs use explanations, cultural capital, and linguistic styling to express ethnoracial identities; however, experiences of denial, objectification, racial imposter syndrome, and anxiety lead many to assess which situations are safe to enact their identities and which are not.

A critical case is spatial communication, where it has been argued that semantic universals should exist, if anywhere. Here, using an experimental paradigm able to separate variation within a language from variation between languages, we tested the use of spatial demonstratives—the most fundamental and frequent spatial terms across languages. In n = 874 speakers across 29 languages, we show that speakers of all tested languages use spatial demonstratives as a function of being able to reach or act on an object being referred to. In some languages, the position of the addressee is also relevant in selecting between demonstrative forms. Commonalities and differences across languages in spatial communication can be understood in terms of universal constraints on action shaping spatial language and cognition.},

	abstract = {ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This thesis examines food and language as a related topic. Gerhardt (2013) claims that every language group has its unique traditional food and, as such, this thesis investigates this claim with specific reference to non-standard linguistic varieties. I analysed memes1 from the Vannie Kaap Facebook page with the purpose of identifying the kinds of identities constructed when using Kaaps to talk about food. The theories of Pennycook (2004) and Butler (1990), which guided my thesis, were used to examine the ways in which language is used to perform different identities. Following this is a discussion on the methodology and data collection instruments. I used thematic analysis to analyse the different text in the memes. This thesis also drew on sociolinguistic theory which is particularly useful when analysing society’s effect on language, including concepts such as ‘context’, ‘cultural norms’ and ‘expectation’ on the way language is used. The theme that became apparent included how food and the consumption thereof was used to highlight issues of social positions within society. Other themes included the significance of food within Kaaps culture, and comparing foods as a strategy to address challenging issues in society. Also relevant to the discussion is the theme of Kaaps as a culture of consumption. My findings suggest that non-standard varieties indeed exhibit their own unique traditional foodways. I further note a generational shift, that is, a shift away from traditional, home-cooked meals to the purchasing of traditional fast foods. My findings highlight the significance and creativity that Kaaps speakers possess by using their language to make political and social commentary through comparing political and social issues to food. These kinds of strategies of resistance against societal norms are what lead to emancipation from stigmas, thus providing speakers with a sense of solidarity and belonging. Taken together, the memes depict how Kaaps speakers use food and language as a means of liberation, emancipation and empowerment.},

Peace sociolinguistics acknowledges all languages to be carriers of human values and capable of bringing different peoples together. In the classic style of grounded theory methodology, primacy is given to language and codes are developed in order to show how English language is used to portray a common reality between two world entities, Pakistan and the EU. This sociolinguistic constructivist grounded theory study is underpinned by social constructionism which takes the view that language does not just describe the world but actively constructs it, having real consequences. The socially constructed reality presented here is shared and contextual and takes the form of a rigorous theory called "a theory of peace sociolinguistics of the EU-Pak discourse in selected Pakistani English newspapers." This theoretical rendering demonstrates the viability of English to be used for peaceful purposes while challenging the current dual status of English as a colonial legacy and a necessary agent of globalization.},

This plurality in TA is often not recognised by editors, reviewers or authors, who promote ‘coding reliability measures’ as universal requirements of quality TA. Focusing particularly on our reflexive TA approach, we discuss quality in TA with reference to ten common problems we have identified in published TA research that cites or claims to follow our guidance. Many of the common problems are underpinned by an assumption of homogeneity in TA. We end by outlining guidelines for reviewers and editors – in the form of twenty critical questions – to support them in promoting high(er) standards in TA research, and more deliberative and reflexive engagement with TA as method and practice.},

This volume is a major advance towards that understanding. Professor Gumperz here synthesizes fundamental research on communication from a wide variety of disciplines - linguistics, sociolinguistics, anthropology and non-verbal communication - and develops an original and broadly based theory of conversational inference which shows how verbal communication can serve either between individuals of different social and ethnic backgrounds. The urgent need to overcome such barriers to effective communication is also a central concern of the book. Examples of conversational exchanges as well as of longer encounters, recorded in the urban United States, village Austria, South Asia and Britain, and analyzed to illustrate all aspects of the analytical approach, and to show how subconscious cultural presuppositions can damagingly affect interpretation of intent and judgement of interspeaker attitude. The volume will be of central interest to anyone concerned with communication, whether from a more academic viewpoint or as a professional working, for example, in the fields of interethnic or industrial relations.},

I defend a definition of racialization and identify its companion concept, “racialized group.” Racialization is often used as a synonym for “racial formation.” I argue that this is a mistake. Racial formation theory is committed to racial ontology, but racialization is best understood as the process through which racialized – rather than racial – groups are formed. “Racialization” plays a unique role in the conceptual landscape, and it is a key concept for race eliminativists and anti-realists about race.},

Where direct inquiries into American white ethnicity have been scant since the millennium’s turn, the authors use recently collected (2014), nationally representative survey data to systematically assess “postmillennial” white ethnic identification. In particular, the authors explore the prevalence of whites identifying with ethnicity today, how this compares with other groups, and how drivers of white ethnic affiliation may have shifted in recent years. The data show that all ethnic claims have declined in the twenty-first-century United States, but the retreat from ethnicity has been accelerated among whites. By the authors’ estimates, only 8.4 percent of whites still claim ethnicity. The authors also find that white ethnic affiliation is now most substantively driven by racial ideology, experience, and perceived victimhood, though some demographic markers remain important. Further analyses show that remaining American white ethnic claimants now perceive white cultural advantages while simultaneously seeing themselves as victims of racial discrimination at rates that rival reports of nonwhites. In sum, these data suggest that white ethnicity has declined but not disappeared as a socially intelligible boundary claim in the postmillennial era and that it has developed as a racialized expression that holds implications for understandings of contemporary white identities, racisms, and resentments.},

Analyses extend the timeline of Elsig (2009)/Elsig and Poplack’s (2006) diachronic analysis by an additional twenty-five years, bringing 2,000+ questions produced by 133 speakers to bear on developments occurring over a period of nearly a century and a half of spontaneous Québec French speech. Results underscore the need to consider more than rates and conditioning in the study of language change. Linguistic dispersion and diffusion in the community provide crucial insight into the mechanics of the transition period and contribute to identifying shifts in variant productivity at each point in time.},

Vernacular forms peak in adolescence, abate in middle age, and increase again in retirement, forming a vernacular tail. A complete understanding of age-grading has been hampered by a lack of empirical evidence across the entire adult trajectory and a relatively narrow understanding of speakers’ motivations to change. This paper presents data from a dynamic panel dataset of Tyneside English speakers, covering successive cohorts over the entire adult lifespan. An analysis of (ing) reveals that the U-shaped curve is occupationally niched; only professional educators demonstrate clear retrenchment followed by a tail. Drawing on educational policy research, we argue this effect is largely driven by institutional (and heavily policed) expectations of UK educational policies. We are the first to demonstrate the occupationally niched nature of the U-shaped curve and provide quantitative evidence of the effect of educational policy on linguistic production.},

Yet, empirical evidence suggests instead that the role of phonetic variation during phonological rule innovation is minor (Fruehwald, 2013, 2016). This paper adds to this ongoing debate an empirical analysis of an emergent allophonic contrast—an “/æ/ nasal system”—in White Michigan English. Analyses of speaker-level acoustic data from a sociolinguistic corpus (n = 36) and a subphonemic judgment task (n = 107) suggest that Lansing exhibits gradual phonological rule emergence. Social conditioning appears to act as the catalyst of phonological rule formation and its spread. The mechanism of actuation was thus “the chance alignment of social and phonetic variability” (Baker, Archangeli, \& Mielke, 2011), suggesting that social conditioning on phonetic variability must play a major role in phonological emergence.},

Competing expressions for these obligation types, besides have to, have got to, and older must, include should and, recently, need to. Two sets of regression analyses provide evidence of covariation of form and function: first, the linguistic and social conditioning of forms, with meaning as one of the predictors; and second, the conditioning of function, with modal form as a predictor. Need to rises in real time and so does talk of personal obligation. However, the change in modal function is concomitant with, but independent of, shifting modal forms.},

Dislocated subjects are produced by the same underlying linguistic mechanisms in both places, with parallel constraints by type of subject and intervening material, suggesting a typological universal. However, SD is age-graded in Kapuskasing, regardless of heritage language. In Parry Sound, it is obsolescent, in steady decline over the twentieth century. We conclude that while typological trends are underlain by universal cognitive processes, locally embedded sociocultural influences are the source of differentiation.},

The research presented forms part of a study on the participation of sexual minorities in ongoing sound change; this study aims to address the continued exclusion of sexual minorities from sociolinguistic studies, which not only invisibilizes queer people, but underlines their behaviour, linguistic or otherwise, as gender-deviant. Using a sociophonetic methodology, an analysis of nasal vowel quality provides evidence for sex- and sexuality-differential linguistic behaviour in the advancement of the nasal vowel chain shift. The results confirm the progressive but non-conformative linguistic behaviour of women, both straight and queer, as outlined by Labov (1990) and numerous other sociolinguistic studies, but also indicate that queer men are centre-stage in driving the change forward. This research is a first step in formalizing data-driven principles about the linguistic behaviour of sexual minorities and their role in language change, akin to the principles advanced to account for the behaviour of women., RÉSUMÉCet article examine l’avancement d’un changement en chaîne des voyelles nasales en français parisien, en étudiant en particulier l’influence du sexe biologique et de la sexualité sur la propagation de ce changement linguistique d’en bas.

	abstract = {Inherent to the debate on creole genesis is the question of grammatical continuity between creoles and their lexifier languages. This issue, in turn, relates to the disputed claim that creoles descend from pidgins: proponents of that claim postulate a negligible degree of grammatical transmission from the lexifier into the creole and no genetic relatedness between them; opponents claim the reverse. To shed light on the issue, this article compares two contact varieties (Guyanais, a French-lexified creole, and Gardiol, a diaspora variety of Occitan) to their respective lexifiers. The comparison shows that although Guyanais and Gardiol can both be called contact varieties, the latter has clearly inherited the grammar of its lexifier, whereas the former gives the appearance of a break in transmission, as predicted by the pidgin-creole cycle theory.},

	abstract = {This qualitative study examined the role of different languages used in the country in the lives of 12 participants from the four main ethnic groups of Sri Lanka (i.e., Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, and Burgher). It sought to understand how monolingual language policies have impacted upon the country's plurilingual language ecology. The study examined the language ideologies of participants to understand how structures of social power have worked through monolingual language policies to influence and shape their language behaviors and practices. While the impact that language policies have had on different Sri Lankan languages has been examined, no study has analyzed it through the point of view of language ideologies of actual speakers of different languages. The observations made by the participants show that the monolingual ideologies of the language policies of 1832 and 1956, by assigning sole official language status to English and Sinhala respectively, have caused them to gain dominance and diminished the status of other languages, thereby altering the plurilingual language ecology of Sri Lanka. Their observations also showed how the 1956 policy's establishment of Sinhala as the dominant language within the language ecology of the country had elevated the position of the majority community—the Sinhalese, and strengthened the power of the then government which had ridden into power through the Sinhalese majority vote. The analysis of data also indicated that, although the 1956 policy was implemented with the aim of dismantling the structures of power introduced during colonial rule, both policies have served to support and reinforce a social hierarchy based on a Western model. What the data revealed about the role that the two monolingual language policies of 1832 and 1956 seem to have played in establishing and reinforcing the dominance of Sinhala and English respectively, suggest that although political subjugation of the country by European powers has officially ended, Sri Lanka continues to operate within the structures of power established during colonial times.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first systematic acoustic analysis of a rhotic accent in present-day England. The dataset comprises spontaneous and elicited speech of 28 speakers from Blackburn in Lancashire, Northern England, where residual rhoticity remains, having never been lost in the earlier sound change which rendered most of England non-rhotic. Although sociolinguistic studies of rhoticity in England exist, we have almost no description of its phonetic properties. Moreover, most sociolinguistic studies focus on the South West of England and relatively little is known about rhoticity in the North. Our study is timely because Northern rhoticity is predicted to disappear in the next few generations, a process which is now complete in many areas of the South West. Our results demonstrate that rhoticity is still present in Blackburn, although non-prevocalic /r/ is weaker when compared to other rhotic varieties of English such as those in Scotland and North America. We find that non-prevocalic /r/ is phonetically weakening in apparent time, with the F3-F2 difference being larger for younger speakers as well as females. We present additional social and linguistic factors affecting its potential demise, and discuss how our results contribute to our understanding of historical /r/-loss in Anglo-English.},

The majority of North American tweets follow suit soon after. The African data show an increase of articles and tweets adopting the feminine after the Académie française's recommendation in May 2020. Finally, the feminine is negligible in the European data. We argue that among the factors at play are dialect-specific differences in French gender and loanword adaptation; the complex relationship among linguistic authorities, the public, and local media; and the relative delay in the Académie française's recommendation of the feminine., RésuméDans cet article, nous nous intéressons au genre du nom ≪ COVID-19 ≫ dans une base de données contenant plus de 76 000 tweets, et dans les médias traditionnels (environ 500 000 articles) en français tel qu'il est utilisé en Afrique, en Amérique (du Nord) et en Europe.

Les données africaines montrent une augmentation des articles et des tweets adoptant le féminin à la suite de la recommandation de l'Académie française en mai 2020.

	abstract = {A long-standing expectation is that large, dense and cosmopolitan areas support socioeconomic mixing and exposure among diverse individuals1–6. Assessing this hypothesis has been difficult because previous measures of socioeconomic mixing have relied on static residential housing data rather than real-life exposures among people at work, in places of leisure and in home neighbourhoods7,8. Here we develop a measure of exposure segregation that captures the socioeconomic diversity of these everyday encounters. Using mobile phone mobility data to represent 1.6 billion real-world exposures among 9.6 million people in the United States, we measure exposure segregation across 382 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and 2,829 counties. We find that exposure segregation is 67\% higher in the ten largest MSAs than in small MSAs with fewer than 100,000 residents. This means that, contrary to expectations, residents of large cosmopolitan areas have less exposure to a socioeconomically diverse range of individuals. Second, we find that the increased socioeconomic segregation in large cities arises because they offer a greater choice of differentiated spaces targeted to specific socioeconomic groups. Third, we find that this segregation-increasing effect is countered when a city’s hubs (such as shopping centres) are positioned to bridge diverse neighbourhoods and therefore attract people of all socioeconomic statuses. Our findings challenge a long-standing conjecture in human geography and highlight how urban design can both prevent and facilitate encounters among diverse individuals.},

I employ Bakhtin’s concepts of ideological becoming, and of authoritative and internally persuasive discourse to explore how the student participants are conscious of language and social worlds, including their heritage language and ethnic group. The data collection in this study took place through semi-structured interviews with four eighth and ninth graders at a Chinese heritage language school in the USA. Based on Tse’s (1998a) ethnic identity development model, three student participants, Arthur, Paul, and Jack, appear to be at Stage 2. However, they express no ideological inheritance: Mandarin Chinese is not my heritage language, which does not fall anywhere along this ‘continuum’ of Stage 2, Ethnic Ambivalence/Evasion, in Tse’s model. Tse (1997) examined the possible links between ethnic identity and language attitude, but Bakhtin’s concepts may provide a more in-depth analysis of the four students’ ethnic identity development. These findings also imply that the Chinese school should provide more opportunities for immigrant students to be exposed to their heritage language and culture, which can help them find connections to the culture and Mandarin Chinese.},

Exposure to and interactions with racially diverse others were not significant predictors of race-related conversations (and their comfort with said conversations). However, interactions with racially diverse friends was related to greater likelihood of discussing race, more frequent discussions of race, and more comfort with race-related conversations.

Existing models speak mainly to discrepancies that occur because explicit attitudes are less prejudiced than implicit attitudes and tends to assume other possible categories are trivial. Using data from two large samples, this study provides a descriptive analysis of the different ways IEDs exist regarding racial attitudes among U.S. Whites. Results suggest IEDs exist largely in line with traditional theories, but there is substantial variation yet to be understood. These results were robust across a variety of measures, although decision-making in the construction of measures can be consequential.

	abstract = {This paper explores language contact phenomena (substrate und superstrate influence, universal learning strategies) in the speech of English-dominant, Hindi-dominant and bilingual speakers of Indian English. In so doing, it describes the nature and extent of linguistic variation that spans a broad sociolinguistic spectrum. The empirical basis of the study targets two domains of language: morpho-syntax (the English present perfect) and discourse pragmatics (quotative marking). The stratification of the informants into English-dominant, Hindi-dominant and bilingual is diagnostic of the sociolinguistic settings in which varieties in contact have been acquired (predominantly English, predominantly Hindi or mixed). The results indicate that superstratal influence is most noticeable in the speech of English-dominant individuals. In contrast, Hindi-dominant and bilingual speakers demonstrate substrate-induced features in their speech. The universal learning strategies of simplification are limited to the linguistic repertoires of the individuals with predominantly Hindi background. Crucially, bilingual speakers appear to engage in the construction of creative coinages and lead an incipient language change in the domain of quotative marking. Against this backdrop, the study shows that bilingualism is a primary sociocognitive condition underpinning speakers’ linguistic creativity and its major prerequisite. The study also pinpoints the importance of sociolinguistic differentiation through meticulous ethnographic fieldwork in the study of linguistic variation.},

	abstract = {In the study of prosodic rhythm, English is a typically characterized as a language with high durational variability between syllables, however contact with languages with low durational variability can cause an English variety to have comparatively lowered durational variability. South Florida’s history of contact between English and numerous Caribbean varieties predicts this type of altered prosodic rhythm. This study explores contact effects in the prosodic rhythm of South Florida (SF) African- and Haitian-Americans by comparing their English rhythm to that of SF Cuban-Americans and North Carolina African-Americans. SF African- and Haitian-American rhythms did not significantly differ from each other or from NC African-Americans for any of the four rhythm measures used (i.e., nPVI-v, \%V, ΔC, and varcoC). Both target groups had significantly higher durational variability than that of Cuban-Americans in three of the four measures. Within the Haitian-American group, participants with higher Haitian Creole usage had significantly more durational variability than those with low Haitian Creole use, contrary to what bilingualism with Haitian Creole predicts. The results suggest prosodic rhythm variation is not necessarily solely due to transfer or substrate effects from other languages, rather there may be social reasons for rhythm variation. durational variability than those who use HC less.},

	abstract = {In New Orleans, there is a white, working-class dialect of English, sometimes called “Yat”, that has several notable similarities with that of New York City. These similarities have been argued to be the result of 19th-century dialect contact between residents of the two cities. This paper examines the palm vowel in New Orleans and argues that it too shows evidence of diffusion from New York around this time period. Words of the palm lexical set that have been part of the English lexicon since before the 19th century, such as father and calm, are found to be merged with the thought phoneme in New Orleans, while more recent palm words such as garage are merged with lot. A handful of traditional lot words, such as John and god, are also sporadically attested with the thought phoneme. Since traditional New York City English also possesses a palm vowel backer than lot, with words such as John and god variably included in it—a pattern that is not widely found in other dialects closely connected to New Orleans English—the findings are interpreted as further evidence for dialect diffusion from New York to New Orleans.},

	abstract = {Second dialect acquisition (SDA) can be defined as the process through which geographically mobile individuals adapt to new dialect features of their first language. Two common methodological approaches in SDA studies could lead to underestimating the phonetic changes that mobile speakers may experience: only large phonetic differences between dialects are considered, and external sources are used to infer what should have been the speakers’ original dialect. By contrast, in this study, we carry out a longitudinal analysis to empirically assess the speakers’ baseline and shift away from it with no priors as to which features should change or not. Furthermore, we focus on Quebec French, a variety with a relatively crowded vowel space. Using Mahalanobis distances, we measure how acoustic characteristics of vowels produced by 15 mobile speakers change relative to those of a control group of 8 sedentary speakers, with the mobile participants recorded right after they moved to Quebec City, then a year later. Overall, the results show a reduction of Mahalanobis distances over time, indicating convergence toward the control system. Convergence also tends to be greater in denser areas of the vowel space. These results suggest that phonetic changes during SDA could be finer than previously thought. This study calls for the use of methodological approaches that can reveal such trends, and contributes to uncovering the extent of phonetic flexibility during adulthood.},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives: The current paper utilizes corpus data to examine variation and potential language contact effects regarding pronominal subject placement among first-generation immigrants in Atlanta, with particular attention paid to the individual speaker. The research questions that guide the study are the following: What linguistic and social predictors govern subject placement in Mexican Spanish spoken in Roswell, GA? What role, if any, does English contact play in the overall preverbal rates and/or constraints that govern subject placement? Do the data show any substantial individual differences with regard to rates of subject placement? If so, how might the inclusion versus exclusion of these speakers influence the overall interpretation of the results?
Design and data: This study employs a variationist sociolinguistic framework, and the speakers comprise 20 first-generation Mexican immigrants living in Georgia.
Analysis: Descriptive statistics are employed for purposes of overall as well as individual usage rates of postverbal subjects. In addition, linguistic (e.g., person/number, priming) and social predictors (e.g., sex, English proficiency, preferred media language) were incorporated into logistic regression analyses using Rbrul.
Findings: Pronominal subject placement is most strongly influenced by person/number. Third-person singular pronouns favor postverbals while other pronouns favor preverbal position. Regarding social predictors, both sex and preferred media language appeared to play significant roles in the initial analysis; however, upon considering outlier speaker effects, the apparent effect of sex disappeared. The media language effect shows that those with a preference for English media favor preverbal subjects, suggesting a potential language contact effect.
Originality and implications: The current study is the first to analyze this phenomenon in southeastern U.S. Spanish. The findings have implications for the study of language contact and change, demonstrating the importance of considering how individual speakers could misrepresent the overall data, interpretations of results, and conclusions in sociolinguistic studies of bilingualism.},

	abstract = {Non-standard orthography on social media provides a useful supplementary data source for sociophonetic research. Regarding an ongoing chain shift in Northern Metropolitan French nasal vowels, spellings reflecting shifted vowel targets are observed on Twitter. These non-standard spellings, e.g. avont [avɔ̃] for avant /avɑ̃/ ‘before’, provide insight into speakers’ awareness of this change and its lexical distribution. Tweets with shifted and standard spellings of 306 word forms containing the phonemes /ɛ̃/, /œ̃/, /ɑ̃/ and /ɔ̃/ were collected from an 870-million word Internet Archive corpus of French tweets from 2011–2017. Shifted spellings were found for all four vowels and 168 words. The shifted spelling rate is lower than that of comparable variables in English and is not conditioned by stress, grammatical category, frequency, or phonological context, which affect the distribution of shifted nasal vowels in speech. However, frequent words show more indications of intentional misspelling, such as repetition and capitalization of the target vowel, suggesting that some speakers are conscious of the variation and comment on it using salient words. The results also contribute to an ongoing debate about a possible merger between /ɛ̃/ and /œ̃/, supporting the hypothesis of an incomplete merger where /ɛ̃/ shifts towards [ɑ̃] but /œ̃/ does not.},

In mainland France, this tendency can be found to various degrees across the country, and is spreading throughout the speech community. This article further develops the picture of the current status of the low vowel contrast by investigating Belgian and Swiss French, where length is known to play overall a far more prominent role in the vowel inventories than it does in standard French. Are Belgian and Swiss French also affected by the merger of the two low vowels? To what extent can a difference in length and/or timbre still be found? And how do the patterns of contrast neutralisation/preservation relate to the developments in France?, Il est communément noté que le français standard est en train de perdre le contraste entre ses deux voyelles basses /a/ et /ɑ/, en raison de l'avancement de la voyelle arrière.

En France métropolitaine, cette tendance peut être constatée à des degrés divers à travers le pays et se répand dans toute la communauté linguistique.

	abstract = {Social media has long been recognized as an important domain for the usage of endangered and minoritized languages, as well as a platform for language-activist activity.  Based on a decade of participant-observation in the Louisiana Creole Virtual Classroom, a revitalization community based on Facebook, this paper describes how speakers and learners of minoritized and endangered languages can form online communities for activism, resource development, learning and teaching. Louisiana Creole is critically endangered and has received little to no institutional support, but the Virtual Classroom has succeeded in creating a large number of new speakers through peer-mediated learning and the creation of learning resources. The orthography developed for the Virtual Classroom has now achieved widespread acceptance. The Virtual Classroom has thus given rise to an enduring revitalization movement with implications extending far beyond social media. Indeed, as this paper argues, scholars and practitioners should be cautious not to view online revitalization through a dichotomous lens which induces an artificial separation between the online and offline. Online language revitalization, like its offline counterpart, is underpinned by language-ideological concerns which are visible in many aspects of the Virtual Classroom’s resource development and activism.

Some thirty years of government policies, social service practices and public perceptions have been framed by a particular understanding of immigration and multicultural diversity. That is, Britain's immigrant and ethnic minority population has conventionally been characterized by large, well-organized African-Caribbean and South Asian communities of citizens originally from Commonwealth countries or formerly colonial territories. Policy frameworks and public understanding – and, indeed, many areas of social science – have not caught up with recently emergent demographic and social patterns. Britain can now be characterized by ‘super-diversity,’ a notion intended to underline a level and kind of complexity surpassing anything the country has previously experienced. Such a condition is distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immigrants who have arrived over the last decade. Outlined here, new patterns of super-diversity pose significant challenges for both policy and research.},

The purpose of the study is to test whether dude/ho implicate the sense of 'obviousness'. The authors designed a questionnaire in which 74 participants of American English and Asturian Spanish assessed the degree to which a recorded speaker was seeking to implicate that an utterance's propositional content should already be known to the listener.

Findings suggest that indeed ho/dude behave in a similar way in each language, serving a regulatory function within the mutual belief space.

	abstract = {This study contributes to the understanding of attitudes towards monolingual and code-switched varieties by examining the perceptions of 95 bilinguals towards Manitoban French, Canadian English and code-switching in Manitoba, a Canadian province where French is a minority language with official federal status. By means of a matched-guise test, we explore French-English bilinguals’ social evaluations of the three linguistic varieties and examine how these social evaluations vary according to participant characteristics (i.e. age, gender, mother tongue, origin, and sociocultural identity). In our experiment, participants listened to a speaker using Manitoban French, Canadian English and code-switching and rated each guise on several solidarity and status traits. Results from the cumulative link mixed effects models reveal that French and English are rated similarly for status. Overall, both French and English elicit feelings of attachment, but a preference towards French emerges among participants born in Manitoba. Code-switching is rated lower than the monolingual varieties in most status and solidarity traits, which indicates that our participants implicitly value linguistic purism. However, results also show that participants born in Manitoba and those with French as their mother tongue ascribe covert prestige to code-switching.},

Rather than a closed, self-contained system, language is an entity that is constantly shaped by such external factors as cognitive forces, pragmatic manipulation, history, etc. These factors are responsible for the emergence of chain-like linguistic structures, and auxiliaries are typical examples of such structures, which Heine describes as grammaticalization chains. A limited number of concrete event schemas are discussed and these schemas are shown to be responsible for much of the linguistic diversity that auxiliary constructions exhibit in the languages of the world.},

The varied sources for the development of AVCs are cursorily introduced and how such constructions further develop into complex verb forms once grammaticalized is briefly discussed.

The first of these tasks has been attended to, but the second has been slighted, with the result that many items labeled 'particles' have been treated as clitics. After some remarks on the nature of 'tests' in linguistics, a series of tests is provided here for distinguishing clitics from independent words. On the basis of these, it is concluded that most of the 'particles' in the literature are simply words; from this conclusion, it is argued that treating words with idiosyncratic distributions as acategorial 'particles' is wrong. We then consider the relevance of various cases of 'particles'-in German, Chrau, Hidatsa, and Welsh-to theoretical proposals about special clitics. These examples include some items that are independent words, some that are inflectional affixes, and others that are independent words with simple clitic variants. Finally, a class of DISCOURSE MARKERS is delineated: a grammatical category of items which are often classified as 'particles' but which turn out, again, to be independent words rather than clitics of any sort.},

A growing body of research in the last 20 years has employed typological and semantic frameworks to demonstrate the diversity and complexity of creole TMA systems. Creoles employ rich inventories of temporal and modal categories whose core meanings interact with the discourse context to produce different interpretations. The syntax of creole TMA also closely follows the universal hierarchy of functional heads proposed by Cinque. The emergence and development of the TMA categories themselves follow general principles of internally and externally motivated change.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This thesis explores how Mauritian Creole’s tense, mood and aspect (TMA) markers have changed over time. The main aim is to provide a detailed historical account for the TMA markers: POU, VA, TI, FINN and PE. I analyse written records from Old (pre-1900), 20th Century and Modern (2000s) Mauritian, and break down the meanings of the markers into ‘features’ to establish prototypical or ‘canonical’ usages in each time period, based on Corbett’s canonical typology approach. I stress the importance of considering lexifier (French) and substrate languages (e.g. Niger-Congo \& Bantu) as well as language-internal change as contributing factors to their development. The changes are investigated from a functional grammaticalization perspective, providing a cross-linguistically comparable framework to examine whether this micro approach to change corresponds with macro grammaticalization paths in the literature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In addition to diachronic study, I use elicitation tasks (both online and in-person tasks) to investigate the synchronic usage of the markers. Through quantitative analysis, these results show whether tendencies observed in the historical analyses continue today. The main contribution of my thesis is the quantification and clarification of the features which make up the meaning of the TMA markers at different stages of their development, in some cases supporting established cross-linguistic patterns, such as imperfective drift (partly attested in PE), in others identifying unexpected developments, such as VA’s later possible obligation meaning in future expression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Overall, I show that Mauritian’s TMA development is more complex and nuanced than expected from cross-linguistic grammaticalization paths. The micro approach taken in this thesis does not always align with the macro grammaticalization paths attested in the literature, and I suggest that polygrammaticalization may better account for the multifaceted nature of certain markers. Unexpected developments pose a challenge for theories of language change, which should be refined by taking into account the empirical evidence presented in this thesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper, we review the morphosyntactic status of TAM markers in two creoles: Kriyol, a Portuguese-based creole, and Mauritian, a French-based creole. Although the markers do not necessarily show adjacency to their hosts, they exhibit tightness with their host and never show total syntactic independence. This suggests they are in the process of grammaticalizing to suffixation, elevating creoles to be inflectionally rich languages contrary to previous assumptions.},

Yet the methods for assessing and characterizing an individual speaker's participation in an ongoing merger (or split) vary widely, especially among researchers analyzing naturalistic corpora. We consider four methodological approaches to representing and assessing vowel difference: Euclidean distances, mixed effects regression modeling (Nycz 2013), the Pillai-Bartlett trace (Hay, Warren, \&amp; Drager 2006), and the spectral overlap assessment metric (Wassink 2006). We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method and compare them by applying all of them to three different data sets, each of which contains low vowel data from speakers whose status with respect to a vowel contrast may not be clear-cut: realizations of COT and CAUGHT in San Francisco, California; COT and CAUGHT among Canadians in the New York City region; and TRAP and BATH among Scots who work in Southern England.

Understanding the implications of merger reversal therefore requires understanding of their implementation: whether there was a full merger in the first place, what the phonetic path taken to separate the merger was, and whether there was a social motivation behind the reversal. I take this approach in a case study of the traditional start-north merger of St. Louis English, which has reversed in recent decades. I show that the merger was most likely a near merger, that the reversal was achieved by raising north and fronting start, and that the reversal, at least the raising of north, was socially motivated. I argue that the data highlights the role of perceptual salience in reversing mergers and illustrates that merger reversal can at times be chain shift-like in appearance, if not execution.},

	abstract = {The current study investigated the merger-in-progress between word-initial nasal and lateral consonants in Fuzhou Min, examining the linguistic and social factors that modulate the merger. First, the acoustic cues to the l-n distinction were examined in Fuzhou Min. Acoustic analyses suggested a collapse of phonemic contrast between prescriptive L and N (phonemes in the unmerged system), with none of the six acoustic cues showing any difference across L and N. Linear discriminant analysis did identify acoustically distinct [l] and [n] tokens, although the mapping onto the phonetic space of prescriptive L and N substantially overlapped. Speakers of all ages and both genders tended to produce [l], and low vowels correlated with more [n]-like classification. In perception, AX discrimination data showed Fuzhou Min listeners confused both prescriptive L and N and acoustic [l] and [n]. Greater sensitivity to the acoustic differences occurred in the context of low vowels and a nasal coda, supported by the acoustics of the stimuli, and younger listeners were more sensitive to the difference between [l] and [n] than older listeners. In two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) identification, Fuzhou Min listeners also identified the merged form as L more frequently than N, with more L responses elicited in the context of low vowels and in the absence of nasal codas. Overall, although Fuzhou Min speakers produced some acoustically distinct [l] and [n] tokens in the context of a sound merger, these productions did not map onto prescriptive L and N. In addition, younger listeners were more sensitive to the acoustic distinction than older listeners, suggesting an emerging acoustic contrast possibly arising due to contact with Mandarin.},

Although grammars of French have traditionally passed over indefinite tu/vous in silence, Ashby's study of Tours French (1992) confirmed that the phenomenon exists in metropolitan French also. The historical time-depth of indefinite tu/vous has apparently not been explored previously, though Posner (1997) has suggested that indefinite tu is a modern feature, found especially in Canada. A survey of indefinite tu/vous in earlier periods and in a range of varieties forms the first part of this paper. Secondly, drawing on a corpus of French spoken in Picardy, northern France, the paper investigates the extent to which this use of the 2nd person pronouns: (i) helps to avoid ambiguity; (ii) co-occurs with another grammatical variable. Unlike the surveys of Montreal and Tours, the Picardy corpus includes a large majority of informants who used tu to address the interviewer, and this too is explored as a potential influence on speakers’ use of 2nd person pronouns with indefinite reference.},

	abstract = {This book looks at the various ways in which time is reflected in natural language. All natural languages have developed a rich repetoire of devices to express time, but linguists have tended to concentrate on tense and aspect, rather than discourse principles. Klein considers the four main ways in which language expresses time - the verbal categories of tense and aspect; inherent lexical features of the verb; and various types of temporal adverbs. Klein looks at the interaction of these four devices and suggests new or partly new treatments of these devices to express temporality.},

	abstract = {Southwest Louisiana Creoles underwent great change between World Wars I and II as they confronted American culture, people, and norms. This work examines that cultural transformation, paying particular attention to the processes of cultural assimilation and resistance to the introduction and imposition of American social values and its southern racial corollary: Jim Crow. As this work makes clear, the transition to American identity transmuted the cultural foundations of French- and Creole-speaking Creole communities. World War I signalled early transformative changes and over the next three decades, the region saw the introduction of English language, new industries, an increasing number of Protestant denominations, and the forceful imposition of racialized identities and racial segregation. Assimilation and cultural resistance characterized the Creole response, but by 1945, southwest Louisiana more closely resembled much of the American South. Creole leaders in churches, schools, and the tourism industry offered divergent reactions; some elite Creoles began looking to Francophone Canada for whitened ethnic identity support while others turned toward the Catholic establishment in Baltimore, Maryland to bolster their faith. Creoles were not the only distinct community to undergo Americanization, but Louisiana Creoles were singular in their response. As this study makes clear – in ways no historian has previously documented – Louisiana Creoles bifurcated as a result of Americanization. This study also contributes to, and broadens, the literature on Acadian identity. Previously, scholars simply assumed that whitened Latins in Louisiana had always identified with Acadia and their black-racialized brethren with Haiti. This thesis, however, suggests that Cajun and Creole are not opposites. Rather, they derive from the same people and culture, and their perceived and articulated difference emerged in response to Americanization. Through a critical analysis of that bifurcation process, this thesis demonstrates how Acadianized identity and culture emerged in the first half of the 20th century.},

	url = {http://www.uni-koeln.de/},
	abstract = {This dissertation investigates the endangered French-lexifier Creole language of Louisiana, Louisiana Creole (LC). The empirical study contains a sociolinguistic and a structural component. The sociolinguistic part reveals a decline of language proficiency across the generations, a lack of intergenerational language transmission, language attrition on the individual level, and the reduction of the functional domains in which LC is used. It is shown that use of LC is restricted to private casual domains and specific interlocutors. 
The linguistic focus in this study is on wh-questions as a cross-linguistically well-researched and deeply structural area. Here, a number of recent changes, which are related to the endangerment of LC, and newly documented structures are found. First, the loss of forms and structures that is typically associated with language endangerment is observable in the reduction of complex interrogative pronouns and the loss of the grammatical distinctions between subject and object forms. Second, a large amount of free variation persists in the interrogative system with regard to wh-expressions, where new lexemes appear and existing items occur in new functions, and even concerning structures. In particular, speakers show varying degrees of acceptance for structures that are not traditionally grammatical in LC, such as wh-scope marking, wh in-situ, and island violations. This structural variation is independent of socio-demographic variables and functional factors only play a minor role. The most relevant variation is present between individual speakers, indicating considerable, unsystematic differences between I-grammars as are characteristic of endangered languages. They represent structural effects of language endangerment on a deep syntactic level that is generally thought to be very resistant to language change. Third, a previously undocumented type of long-distance question appears which is analyzed as a wh-copying construction in support of the copy-theory of movement.},

	abstract = {Linguistic landscape (LL) refers to linguistic objects that mark the public space. This paper compares patterns of LL in a variety of homogeneous and mixed Israeli cities, and in East Jerusalem. The groups studied were Israeli Jews, Palestinian Israelis and non-Israeli Palestinians from East Jerusalem, of whom most are not Israeli citizens. The study focused on the degree of visibility on private and public signs of the three major languages of Israel-Hebrew, Arabic and English. This study reveals essentially different LL patterns in Israel's various communities: Hebrew–English signs prevail in Jewish communities; Arabic Hebrew in Israeli–Palestinian communities; Arabic–English in East Jerusalem. Further analyses also evince significant – and different – discrepancies between public and private signs in the localities investigated. All in all, LL items are not faithfully representative of the linguistic repertoire typical of Israel's ethnolinguistic diversity, but rather of those linguistic resources that individuals and institutions make use of in the public sphere. It is in this perspective that we speak of LL in terms of symbolic construction of the public space which we explain by context-dependent differential impacts of three different factors – rational considerations focusing on the signs' expected attractiveness to the public and clients; aspirations of actors to give expression to their identity through their choice of patterns that, in one way or another, represent their presentation of self to the public; and power relations that eventually exist behind choices of patterns where sociopolitical forces share relevant incompatible interests.},

Ces années ont vu la domination du français disparaître en Louisiane, et des familles de Créoles blancs devenir peu à peu anglophones monolingues. Nous avons ici analysé en micro-sociolinguistique un corpus de lettres privées échangées par quatre familles, collectées dans les archives de différentes universités de Louisiane, avec comme thème privilégié l’éducation des enfants. Nous cherchons à montrer comment cette population est passée du bilinguisme au monolinguisme, et quels ont été les facteurs internes aux familles dans ce transfert linguistique.},
